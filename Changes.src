=head1 Introduction

This file documents the changes to each and every release of the
MQSeries perl API, going back as far as the 1.02 release.

=head1 Changes for 1.35

Makefile.PL and util/parse_headers:
Multiple definition of MQI_BY_VALUE_STR error fixed, even though
this seems like a bug in a new header file that comes with MQ v8

MQSeries/Properties.pm:
Object destructor (DESTROY) required valid Hconn, but Hconn might
have been removed, causing "MQDLTMH failed" error with reason 2018.

=head1 Changes for 1.34

MQClient/typemap.PL will handle MQINT64 like how it handles MQHMSG.

MQSeries/Comamnd/Base.pm: In untraslatePCF, the filters handled
properly.  Filters may also apply to MQCFT_INTEGER64 and 
MQCFT_INTEGER64_LIST as well as the shorter kinds.

MQSeries/Command.pm : Added support for ChlAuth and Comminfo objects 
of mqv7.1.

MQSeries/ErrorLog/Parser.pm: addied a 'ip.ad.dre.ss (port)' parser
for the error log

MQSeries/ErrorLog/descriptions.pl:
Allow single-character hostnames.  more likely this is the first
character of an ip address where the first octet is a single digit.
Add AMQ6048 for dbcs error.

MQSeries/Message/RFH2.pm : Modified based CPAN user's input. It 
handles NameValueData correctly. Also sets the default Format to 
MQFMT_NONE instead of undef.

util/parse_headers:
Some defines are now both compound (ie, they are multiple macros |'ed
together) and the last one ends in L, so the check for the former must
move above the check for the latter so that it works with 7.1
string leading and trailing spaces from or'ed values.  This makes the
postponed parsing of or'ed defines work, where the or'ed define has
spaces inside the parentheses.

=head1 Changes for 1.33

=head2 Major work on Statistics messages and PCF types

Support for the decoding of MQ v6 Accounting/Statistics messages was
added to the PCF decoder, along with the new types these messages use.
Though not strictly necessary, support for these types (MQCFT_GROUP,
MQCFT_INTEGER64, and MQCFT_INTEGER64_LIST) is intended to be complete
throughout the PCF framework, so encoding should work as well.

New message subtypes MQSeries::Message::Accounting and
MQSeries::Message::Statistics were added for this, both of which are
derived from the new MQSeries::Message::System class, which mainly
exists to handle the decoding of the messages.  The already existing
MQSeries::Message::Event class was reparented to here.

=head2 MQSC and PCF enhancements

The encoding/decoding for KeepAliveInterval has been addressed, and
support for more PCF and MQSC commands have been added, and more MQ v7
items and types were included as well.  This should make the
administration of a z/OS queue manager more complete.

Note that as a part of this, the CreateAuthInfo and ChangeAuthInfo
commands now require the AuthInfoType parameter which was previously
optional.

=head2 Minor tweaks

MQSeries::Queue now allows a queue to be called "0".  Previously this
was mistaken to be a false value (ok, it is, but it's also a defined
and non-zero-length string, so you should be able to use it).

MQSeries::Command was mixing up the DefinitionType setting on queues
when creating or updating local and model queues.  In particular, you
may end up with a PermDyn model queue where this is wrong, or the
failure to delete a dynamic queue, in order to recreate as a local
queue.

MQSeries::QueueManager now explicitly sets the get/put counters it
keeps to 0.  This is to eliminate messages of the form:

    Currently  puts and 3 gets pending

where the number of "puts" is simply missing.

An old bug in MQSeries::Message::PCF was removed (wrt the Header and
Parameters methods) once the new MQSeries::Message::System class was
added.  It was completely wrong, so clearly no one had used it before
now.  It's better now.  An old memory leak in MQEncodePCF in PCF.xs
was also squashed (affected parties may have noticed a slow but
continuing increase in memory size of a process that was sending lots
of PCF messages).

=head2 Important note for MQv5 and perl 5.6 users

With the addition of the MQ v6 Statistics and Accounting support in
this release, as well as the new PCF stuff, the possibility exists
that the MQSeries perl module no longer supports either MQ v5 or perl
5.6.  Support for these will be at a best effort kind of basis, but
with the caveat that the maintainers no longer use either of these amy
will likely not be able to replicate anything close to an environment
involving either of this if you have any problems.

=head1 Changes for 1.32

The following fixes are included in the 1.32 release:

=head2 ReasonQualifier Macro Translation

Markus Sonderegger requested MQReasonQualifierToStrings(),
MQReasonQualifierToMacro(), and MQReasonQualifierToText() functions
(and the associated hashes) to translate the ReasonQualifier values to
something more human-friendly.

=head2 SSL Improvements

SSLPeerName is now handled as part of the ClientConn passed to
MQCONNX(), and also when passed as part of a channel definition when
writing a channel table file.

More SSL-related event types are now defined.

=head2 MQSeries::Command fix for InquireChannelNames

Investigation of a problem report with InquireChannelNames led to the
discovery of a gap between the documentation and server-side
implementation of InquireChannelNames.  Channel names are now taken
from the last PCF response instead of the first on the grounds that
that one is much more likely to contain the actual answer.

=head2 Portability / Better code

Some types were adjusted to better match the places where they are
used and to avoid compiler warnings from some platforms/compilers.
Similarly, some C++ style comments were changed to C comments so that
pre-C99 compilers will be happy.

The MQHMSG type is now translated to/from a perl type better.

Macros that are defined to enable backwards compatible building
against older MQ installs are now wrapped in #ifdef/#endif to avoid
compiler warnings.

The hex() function is now used to translate stringified hexadecimal
into a number instead of eval().  Fix suggested by an anonymous
well-intentioned problem ticket.

A number of places in the code path for generation of a channel table
could lead perl to emit warnings about undef.  Reasonable defaults
have been applied to eliminate these.

The test for MQSTAT() has been updated to match the current state of
the art.

=head2 MQSeries::Command fix for CreateObject

CreateObject() would fail to create a local queue if a dynamic queue
already existed with the same name because they have the same QType (a
previously existing remote queue would be deleted first because the
QType is different).  Now we also check the DefinitionType to see if a
dynamic queue should be replaced with a local queue.

=head1 Changes for 1.31

The following fixes are included in the 1.31 release:

=head2 XS code cleanup

Fix support for builds on Solaris, and a few places where filters
weren't completely supported properly.  Add some type casts to quiet
some compiler warnings, and a workaround for non-C99 systems.

=head2 Minor bugfixes

Adjust the projected test count for one script to match the number of
tests, fix an undefined variable use warning in MQSeries/Command.pm,
and a parameter validation inaccuracy in MQSeries/QueueManager.pm.

=head1 Changes for 1.30

The following changes are included in the 1.30 release:

=head2 Support for properties (MQ v7)

The low-level API and the MQSeries::XXX classes have been extended
with support for properties.  There is a new MQSeries::Properties
class and the existing MQSeries::Queue and MQSeries::Message
classes have been extended with new methods.

=head2 Support for asynchronous put status information (MQ v7)

The low-level API and the MQSeries::QueueManager class have been
extended with support for asynchronous put status information.  In the
low-level API, the function is MQSTAT; in the MQSeries::QueueManager
class, the method is StatusInfo.

=head2 MQSeries::Command enhancements for MQ v7

The MQSeries::Command class now supports the new MQ v7 attributes for
PCF commands on distributed platforms, i.e. it supports querying and
modifying the new queue manager, queue and channel attributes
introduced with MQ v7.  Support for Topic and Subscription objects has
been added to MQSeries::Command.

=head2 MQSeries::Command enhancements to support filter commands

The MQSeries::Command class now supports filter commands for MQ v6 and
above.  This allows Inquire commands to include a filter that is
evaluated by the queue manager and reduces the result set to items
matching the filter (query).

=head2 XS code cleanup

Significant cleanups in the low-level XS code should make it possible
to run with warnings enabled without getting large numbers of "use of
uninitialized value" messages at run-time.

=head2 Updated examples

The example scripts have been updated; most notably, a new set of
request/reply scripts demonstrates handling syncpoint, poison
messages, and dynamic queues.

=head1 Changes for 1.29

The following fixes are included in the 1.29 release:

=head2 Initial support for MQ v7

The module now compiles with MQ v7 and new constants are supported.
Support for new and enhanced APIs is not yet in place.  During
configuration, some warnings will occur for unknown datatypes.  This
is expected and can be ignored.

Feedback on which MQ v7 features should be supported in the next
module release is welcome.

=head2 MQSeries::Command fixes

Minor changes for queue-sharing groups and for the
HeaderCompression/MessageCompression attributes.

=head2 Support SecurityParms in MQCONNX

Duke Nguyen contributed support for the SecurityParms data structure
with the MQCONNX call

=head2 SSL tutorial

Morten Bjoernsvik contributed a cookbook on using SSL with the
MQSeries client and server.

=head2 Minor bugfixes

Morten Bjoernsvik contributed a bugfix to the MQSeries::Queue module,
avoiding a call to MQCLOSE if no queue manager connection exists.

=head2 ChannelTable fixes

Recent V6 client releases are more picky in how they parse v4 channel
table files (the format native to the MQ 5.0 client release).  The
MQSeries::Config::ChannelTable file has been updated to reflect this.

=head2 MQSeries::Command fixes

Add the missing ChannelStatistics attribute for Channel commands.

=head1 Changes for 1.28

The following fixes are included in the 1.28 release:

=head2 Compilation fixes when used with MQ v5

The changes for release 1.27 broke MQSeries::Command when used with
an MQ v5 client.

=head2 Fix client/server detection on Windows

Patrick Lanners supplied a patch to improve the testing for the client
or server API on Windows.

=head1 Changes for 1.27

The following fixes are included in the 1.27 release:

=head2 New entries in the AMQERR0x.LOG parser

A number of additional message descriptions have been added to the
configuration file for the AMQERR0x.LOG parser
(MQSeries::ErrorLog::Parser).  The newly supported messages are
specific to MQ v6 on Linux/Unix/Windows.

The AMQERR0x.LOG parser does not yet support all new MQ v6 messages.
Error reports (including AMQERR0x.LOG files) are welcome.

=head2 Other changes made:

=over 4

=item *

Updated MQSC command attributes for OS/390 WMQ6 queue managers.

=item *

Added/Updated PCF commands/attributes for both Mainframe and Distributed queue managers.

=item *

Added support for BYSTRING parameters like ConnectionId.

=back

=head1 Changes for 1.26

The following fixes are included in the 1.26 release:

=head2 Updated entries for AMQ9001 and AMQ9002

IBM has changed the AMQERR log format for the above codes.
Updated descriptions.pl file in the Errorlog directory.

=head2 Correct the RequestParameterOrder for SetAuthorityRecord

Thanks to "Jean-Yves Baudy [jy.baudy@free.fr]" for pointing this out.
Corrected the RequestParameterOrder file to expect the correct order.

=head2 Fix the InquireChannelStatus PCF command 

Updated the ChannelStatus block in RequestParameters file with 
all the necessary optional parameters.

=head1 Changes for 1.25

The 1.24 release, though long-delayed, was plagued by glitches.  Our
only excuse is that it had been too long since the last release and we
were out of practice.  Let's hope the 1.25 release is better.

=head2 Add missing generated files

The MQSeries 1.24 release accidentally went out without the required
generated files.  This has been corrected.

=head2 Fix link RPATH glitches on 64-bit Linux

The RPATH for 64-bit linux systems ended up as /opt/mqm/lib6464 due to
duplicate addition of the '64' postfix.  This has been fixed.

=head2 Remove vestigial MQ v2 and OS/390 support

Support for the MQ v2 release has been removed.  The lowest supported
MQ release is now 5.2 and the lowest supported perl release is now
perl 5.6.

In a similar manner, the incomplete and known to be broken OS/390
support is removed.  The module will still work with z/OS queue
managers; it just won't try and compile on OS/390 anymore.

=head2 Remove outdated PubSub support

Support for the outdated pre-MQSI v2 publish/subscribe classes
(MQSeries::PubSub, MQSeries::Message::RulesFormat) has been removed.

=head2 Switch to Params::Validate

The VerifyNamedParams method in the MQSeries::Utils has been dropped
and is replaced by the use of the Params::Validate module.  This is a
new dependency that must be installed before the MQSeries module.

=head1 Changes for 1.24

=head2 Add support for MQ v6 in MQSeries::Command

Support for all new parameters in PCF and MQSC commands; support for
mainframe PCF commands; and several new PCF commands such as
C<InquireQueueManagerStatus>, C<InquireUsage> and the
authority-related commands.

=head2 Fix a bug in MQSeries::Config::QMgr

Monique Diaz reported a bug in MQSeries::Config::QMgr, where
re-parsing a changed queue manager config file would lead to an
incorrect method invocation.

=head2 Fix documentation for Carp parameter

Herb Williams reported that the examples for the 'Carp' parameter were
broken.  They should now make more sense and actually work.

=head1 Changes for 1.23

=head2 New MQSeries::Message::RFH2 class

A new class to support RFH2 messages; this allows interaction with JMS
clients and the various WMQ Integrator products.

This message type is experimental and lightly tested (bugreports and
patches welcome).  Thanks to Tim Kimber for working on this.

=head2 Support for NonPersistentMsgClass

The new queue attribute C<NonPersistentMsgClass>, which is available
for Local and Model queues starting with WMQ 5.3 CSD06, is now
supported by MQSeries::Command::PCF and MQSeries::Command::MQSC.

=head1 Changes for 1.22

=head2 Support for the MQ Client on Linux / Itanium

Add 64-bit client support for Linux / Itanium.  This should also make
it easy to add support for other 64-bit clients - but note that each
scuh platform will need to adjust the util/parse_headers script.
Patches for other platforms are welcome.

=head2 Support for SCO OpenServer / MQSeries 5.0

Leonid Lisovskiy contributed patches to make the MQSeries module
compile on SCO OpenServer 5.0.6 using the WillowTech MQSeries 5.0
client.

=head2 MQSeries::Command fixes

Support IndexType "GroupId" for shared queues on z/OS in
MQSeries::Command::MQSC.

=head1 Changes for 1.21

=head2 Fixes for MQSeries::Message::IIH

Jeff Dunn contributed patches to the IMBS Bridge Header class
MQSeries::Message::IIH that make it work on both little-endian and
big-endian platforms.  By default, the module assumes client and
server will run on platforms with the same endian-ness; this can be
overridden if this is not the case.

=head2 Fix for MQSeries::Queue Get() failure with MQRC_FORMAT_ERROR

When a message has format MQFMT_NONE; sender and receiver run on
platforms with different endian-ness; and the receiver specifies
Get-Message Option MQGMO_CONVERT; then MQ returns completion code
MQCC_WARNING and reason code MQRC_FORMAT_ERROR.

The MQSeries::Queue Get() method used to treat this as an error.  In
this particular case (Format MQFMT_NONE), the warning can be ignored.
The method now treats this as a succesful read.

=head2 Use version 2 of MQMD, MQGMO, MQPMO by default

The MQGET, MQPUT and MQPUT1 functions now use MQMD version 2 and MQGMO
version2 by default; MQPUT and MQPUT1 now use MQPMO version2 by
default if a distribution list is specified.  Applications using
message grouping, segmentation, or distribution lists no longer have
to specify the MsgDesc, GetMsgOpts or PutMsgOpts version explicitly.

It is still possible to set a higher MQMD, MQGMO or MQPMO version
explicitly.  Note that this change will break use of older (pre-5.0)
queue managers, but as these are over 5 years out of date, this should
not matter.

=head2 Handle too-short input data

Howard Muten noted that specifiying a too-short correlation id on
MQPUT resulted in garbage bytes written to MQ.  This turned out to be
a generic problem, where user-supplied data that was too short was
copied in with whatever memory contenst was following.  This has been
fixed in the typemap code.

=head2 Add support for SSL connect options to MQCONNX and MQSeries::QueueManager

Brian Bumpass contributed XS code to add support for the SSLConfig
options to the C<MQCONNX> call, as well as support for the additional
ClientConn parameters introduced in WMQ 5.3.  These options have also
been added to the MQSeries::QueueManager class.  Use of these options
obviously requires a WMQ 5.3 client with the optional SSL support
installed and configured.

=head2 MQSeries::Command supports direct mainframe connectivity

The MQSeries::Command class now supports connecting directly to the
mainframe (z/OS) using client connections.  As the default syncpoint
behavior on MQPUT for this platform is different, this module now
explicitly specifies MQPMO_NO_SYNCPOINT when writing a message.

=head2 Improve support for WMQ 5.3 queue-sharing groups

On the mainframe (z/OS), WMQ 5.3 supports queue-sharing groups.  The
MQSeries::Command::MQSC classes have been extended to support the
following features:

=over 4

=item *

Add the 'Shared' option to the queue DefinitionType parameter values

=item *

In CreateObject(), do not alter the object but delete and recreate it
when either the QSharingGroupDisposition or CFStruct attributes has
changed.

=back

=head2 Support for V7 channel tables in MQSeries::Config::ChannelTable

Mike Surikov contributed further patches to support reading and
writing of channel table files, including fields new with version 7 of
this file (WMQ 5.3).  Generation and parsing of the older versions is
still supported.

=head2 Alter link libraries for AIX

James FitzGibbon contributed some configure options for Makefile.PL to
pick the right MQ libraries on AIX.

=head2 Drop deprecated options, methods for MQSeries::Queue

The deprecated option C<NoAutoOpen> for the MQSeries::Queue
constructor C<new> is no longer supported.

The deprecated MQSeries::Queue methods C<Commit>, C<Backout> and
C<Pending> are no longer supported.  Obviously, these methods are
still supported on the MQSeries::QueueManager object.

=head2 Drop deprecated option for MQSeries::QueueManager

The deprecated option C<NoAutoConnect> for the MQSeries::QueueManager
constructor C<new> is no longer supported.

=head1 Changes for 1.20

=head2 Improve MQSeries::Command::PCF support for clusters

Minor fixes for the C<InquireClusterQueueManager> command; add support
for C<RefreshCluster> command.  At this time, support for
C<ResetCluster>, C<SuspendQueueManagerCluster> and
C<ResumeQueueManagerCluster> is not planned (patches are welcome).

=head2 Support file handles in writeFile() for MQSeries::Config::ChannelTable

T. Rob Wyatt requested the ability to write to a caller-supplied
filehandle in the MQSeries::Config::ChannelTable C<writeFile> method;
this allows him to supply channel tables from a CGI script without
having to create temporary files.

Support for this is now provided using the new C<FileHandle> parameter
to the C<writeFile> method.

=head2 Support for V6 channel tables in MQSeries::Config::ChannelTable

Mike Surikov contributed patches to support reading and writing of
version 6 client channel table files.  Previous releases did not
handle all fields.  The default version of files written is now
version 6, though generation and parsing of the older version format
is still supported.

=head2 New MQSeries::Message::Trigger class

A new class to support trigger monitor messages; this allows you to
write a trigger monitor in perl.

=head2 Alter link libraries for Linux and HP-UX

On Linux and HP-UX, the MQ libraries are different for single- and
multi-threaded programs.  The makefile now tries to pick the right
libraries based on the 'usethread' parameter in Config.pm.

=head2 Fix the MQSeries::Command->Escape() method

Mike Surikov supplied a patch that makes the 'Escape' method of
MQSeries::Command work.  This is used when sending MQSC commands using
PCF.

=head2 Deprecated parameters generate a warning

The deprecated parameters C<NoAutoConnect> for
C<MQSeries::QueueManager> and C<NoAutoOpen> for C<MQSeries::Queue>
will generate a run-time warning whether -w is enabled or not.  In the
next release, the warning becomes a fatal error.

=head2 Deprecated methods generate a warning

The deprecated C<MQSeries::Queue> methods C<Commit>, C<Backout> and
C<Pending> will generate a run-time warning whether -w is enabled or
not.  In the next release, the warning becomes a fatal error.

=head2 Drop old platforms and releases

This release drops support for MQSeries 5.0, Solaris 2.5.1 and IRIX.
We have not made any changes to the code that should affect these
platforms and releases, but no longer have hese host types around.  
If you care about these platforms, we'll be happy to merge patches to
keep them working.

=head1 Changes for 1.19

=head2 API change for Get/Put methods of MQSeries::Queue

In previous releases, specifying the C<PutMsgOpts> with the C<Put>
method or the C<GetMsgOpts> with the C<Get> method of
C<MQSeries::Queue> meant that C<Sync>, C<Wait> and C<Convert>
parameters were ignored.

This has now changed: the C<Sync>, C<Wait> and C<Convert> parameters
will be honored and be combined with the get/put options specified
with the C<PutMsgOpts> or C<GetMsgOpts> parameters.

The C<Get> method C<Wait> and C<Convert> parameters will override the
C<GetMsgOpts> options flag.

The C<Get> and C<Put> method C<Sync> paramater will check the
C<GetMsgOpts> or C<PutMsgOpts> options flag for compatibility.  If a
coflicting syncpoint option is already set, a fatal error will be
raised.  If no conflicting option is set (this means the options flkag
either has no syncpoint flag set at all, or has the requested flag set
already), the requested C<Sync> paramater will be added to the options
flag.

This means the following will now work:

    my $result = $request_queue->
      Get('Message'    => $get_message,
          'GetMsgOpts' => 
          {
            'Options'  => (MQSeries::MQGMO_SYNCPOINT_IF_PERSISTENT |
                           MQSeries::MQGMO_FAIL_IF_QUIESCING),
          },
          'Wait'       => '30s',
         );

In the past, this would cause the C<Wait> flag to be silently ignored.

This incompatible API change may break your code.  As it significantly
enhances the safety of your code, this is deemed a price worth paying.

=head2 New MQSeries::Message::ConfigEvent class

WebSphere MQ 5.3 on z/OS can generate configuration change events that
cannot be read on Unix and NT queue managers - distributed queue
managers are not able to convert PCF version2 messages.  The
MQSeries::Message::ConfigEvent class can be used to process such
messages - highly useful to create an audit log.

=head2 New MQSeries::Message::IIH class

A new class to support IMS Bridge Header (IIH) messages.  This is due
to Nathan Dupra of Xerox USA.  This class is based on reverse
engineering and somewhat experimental - feedback on functionality or
the API is welcome.

=head2 Add support for WebSphere MQ 5.3 on z/OS

A number of minor changes have been made to support MQSeries::Command
with the 5.3 release (now branded WebSphere MQ) on z/OS.  Note that
PTF UQ68236 is required - the MQSC output of "Display Queue" is
invalid without that PTF, leading to errors with the C<InquireQueue>
method.

=over 4

=item *

Support for AuthInfo objects in C<MQSeries::Command>, mostly through
changes in the C<MQSeries::Command::MQSC::*> tables.

=item *

Support for CFStruct (Coupling Facility Application Structure) objects
in C<MQSeries::Command>, mostly through changes in the
C<MQSeries::Command::MQSC::*> tables.

=item *

Support for the new Channel attributes in C<MQSeries::Command>, mostly
through changes in the C<MQSeries::Command::MQSC::*> tables.  The new
attributes are C<BatchHeartBeat>, C<KeepAliveInterval>,
C<LocalAddress>, C<SSLCipherSpec>, C<SSLClientAuth> and
C<SSLPeerName>.

=item *

Support for the new QueueManager attributes in C<MQSeries::Command>,
mostly through changes in the C<MQSeries::Command::MQSC::*> tables.
The new attributes are C<ConfigurationEvent>, C<ExpiryInterval>,
C<SSLKeyRepository>, C<SSLCRLNamelist>, C<SSLCryptoHardware> and
C<SSLTasks>.

=item *

Support for the new Queue attributes in C<MQSeries::Command>,

The new attribute is C<PageSetId>.

=item *

Support for the new Namelist attributes in C<MQSeries::Command>,
mostly through changes in the C<MQSeries::Command::MQSC::*> tables.
The new attribute is C<NamelistType>.

=back

=head2 New features for MQSeries::Command

The C<MQSeries::Command> constructor now accepts a C<CommandQueue>
parameter.  This allows you to open an arbitrary queue with arbitary
options, then use it so send commands.

In addition, a new C<MsgDesc> method for C<MQSeries::Command> can be
used to fine-tune the message descriptor for outgoing commands.

These new features can be used to open an arbitarry queue and override
message persistence, as some users requested; internally, we sue it to
set the accounting options on outgoing messages, which are then
archived by the WMQ 5.3 configuration events on z/OS.

=head2 Better decoding of MQSC results

Mike Surikov pointed out more bugs in the decoding of MQSC result
messages in C<MQSeries::Command>.  I've added more fixes...

=head2 Parameter verification for MQSeries::QueueManager

The parameters to the major methods of the C<MQSeries::QueueManager>
class (C<new>, C<Connect>, C<Close>) are now enforced.  Specifying
invalid parameter names will lead to a fatal run-time error.

=head2 Parameter verification for MQSeries::Queue

The parameters to the major methods of the C<MQSeries::Queue> class
(C<new>, C<Open>, C<Get>) are now enforced.  Specifying invalid
parameter names will lead to a fatal run-time error.

=head2 New 'Convert' option for MQSeries::Queue Get method

The C<Get> method of C<MQSeries::Queue> has a new C<Convert> option.
This is true by default, but can be set to false if conversion is not
required.  This is useful when manually converting messages, e.g. WMQ
5.3 configuration events.

=head2 Deprecated parameters generate a warning if -w is enabled

The deprecated parameters C<NoAutoConnect> for
C<MQSeries::QueueManager> and C<NoAutoOpen> for C<MQSeries::Queue>
will generate a warning if -w is enabled.  In the next release, the
warning becomes mandatory.

=head2 Deprecated methods generate a warning if -w is enabled

The deprecated C<MQSeries::Queue> methods C<Commit>, C<Backout> and
C<Pending> will generate a warning if -w is enabled.  In the next
release, the warning becomes mandatory.

=head1 Changes for 1.18

=head2 Add support for WebSphere MQ 5.3

A number of minor changes have been made to support the 5.3 release
(now branded WebSphere MQ).

=over 4

=item *

The format of AMQERR01.LOG files has changed: the record separator can
now contain a filename and line.  Update to C<MQSeries::ErrorLog::Parser>.

=item *

The product name in many message in the AMQERR01.LOG file has changed;
some error messages have been added and others have minor changes.
Update to C<MQSeries::ErrorLog::descriptions.pl>.

=item *

The format of FDC files has changed: the product name at the start of
each record has changed. Update to C<MQSeries::FDC::Parser>, which now
supports both the old and the new product name.

=item *

Support for AuthInfo objects in C<MQSeries::Command>, mostly through
changes in the C<MQSeries::Command::PCF::*> tables.

=item *

Support for the new C<InquireQueueStatus> command, mostly through
changes in the C<MQSeries::Command::PCF::*> tables.

=item *

Support for the new Channel attributes in C<MQSeries::Command>, mostly
through changes in the C<MQSeries::Command::PCF::*> tables.  The new
attributes are C<BatchHeartBeat>, C<LocalAddress>, C<SSLCipherSpec>,
C<SSLClientAuth> and C<SSLPeerName>.

=item *

Support for the new QueueManager attributes in C<MQSeries::Command>,
mostly through changes in the C<MQSeries::Command::PCF::*> tables.
The new attributes are C<ConfigurationEvent>, C<SSLKeyRepository>,
C<SSLCRLNamelist> and C<SSLCryptoHardware>.

=head2 Support ChannelTable reading/writing on Windows NT

Jim Wendorf reported that the C<MQSeries::Config::ChannelTable> file
did not reliably read and write channel tables on Windows NT.  This
was due to missing binmode() statements and sort order issues and has
now been fixed.

=head2 Improved client/server API detection

Edwin Haswell contributed code for improved client vs server API
support.  The plain "use MQSeries;" code should now work again for
client installations.

=head2 Add support for MQSC InquireQueueStatus command

The C<MQSeries::Command> class now supports the C<InquireQueueStatus>
command when using MQSC commands.  This works against mainframe queue
managers running MQSeries release 5.2 and up.

=head2 Remove support for perl5.004

The MQSeries module now requires perl5.005.  We test internally with
both perl5.005 and perl5.6.

=head2 Strict argument checking for MQSeries::Command constructor

The MQSeries::Command constructor now performs strict parameter name
validation and will throw an exception (using confess()) if an invalid
parameter name is passed.

This has the potential of breaking existing, but buggy, code.  Similar
changes will be made to many of the other classes and methods in
upcoming releases.

=head2 Modified message retry handling in MQSeries::Queue Get()

Paul Meekin submitted an interesting bug showing we got message retry
wrong when the initial data buffer is too large and message conversion
is required (reason code MQRC_TRUNCATED_MSG_FAILED).  Effectively, we
were re-using the MQMD returned after the warning, which caused the
requested coded character set and encoding to be ignored.  This is now
fixed.

However, this bug also showed that some of the retry logic was
non-functional; the non-working code has now been removed.  The retry
logic failed in the following (rare) corner-case:

=over 4

=item * 

You are getting a string message and requesting conversion

=item * 

The data buffer specified is large enough to hold the message before
conversion

=item *

The message expands during conversion (e.g., Latin-1 to UTF-8)

=item *

The data buffer specified is not large enough to hold the message
after conversion

=back

It turns out that in this case (when MQCC_WARNING and
MQRC_CONVERTED_STRING_TOO_BIG is returned) is not retryable.  The only
thing the application can do, if the message was read under syncpoint,
is to roll back and try again with a properly sized data buffer.

=head2 Reduced memory usage for MQSeries::Command

The MQSeries::Command module will now delay loading for the
sub-classes MQSeries::Command::PCF and MQSeries::Command::MQSC until
either one is actually used.  Under most circumstances, this will save
a substantial amount of memory.  Apache mod_perl users may want to
pre-load the relevant sub-class as part of their startup script.

=head2 Support for ClientConn options with MQCONNX

Hirosi Taguti noted that the MQCONNX call did not properly support
client-connection options.  After he persisted in his bug reports for
a year, we finally fixed it - which required adding some XS code.
Note that the syntax for the ClientConn options may be different than
expected, as the MQCNO 'versions' and 'Options' flags must also be
accomodated:

  $HConn = MQCONNX($QmgrName, 
                   { 'ClientConn' => { 'ChannelName'   => 'FOO',
                                       'TransportType' => 'TCP',
                                       'ConnectionName' => "hostname(1414)",
                                     },
                   },
                   $CompCode, 
                   $Reason);

The C<MQSeries::QueueManager> class now uses MQCONNX and supports an
optional C<ClientConn> parameter to specify these options.

=head2 Support MQ 5.2 CSD03 and CSD04

Various people noted that MQSeries 5.2 CSD03 and CSD04 caused a number
of tests to break.  This is because the various header files now
provide two different values for various constants, depending on
whether you compile in 32-bit mode or 64-bit mode.  As we are not
running a full C pre-processor, that broke the constant parsing.

We now support these changed header files, though we do not yet
support the 64-bit client mode on Solaris (patches are welcome).

=head1 Changes for 1.17

=head2 Parameter order for PCF commands

Jim Hildebrand at MQ Software tried to use the MQSeries::Command suite
on Windows 2000 and discovered that the order in which PCF command
options are specified was dependent on the platform hash key ordering,
even though the PCF command server requires a specific ordering for
some keys.  The perl hash key ordering happened to work on Solaris,
but broke on Windows 2000 (and possibly other platforms).

=head2 Final message for mainframe MQSC commands

Joseph Sacco at Starwood Hotels reported that the MQSeries::Command
suite, when run against a mainframe using MQSC commands, gave annoying
errors messages because the terminating response line on his mainframe
queue manager has a different format from ours.

We now accept both formats.  If you run MQSeries::Command against a
mainframe and get error messages like:

    Unrecognized MQSC buffer: /T2 CSQMDRTS ' DISPLAY QUEUE' NORMAL COMPLETION

then please get in touch and send us the error message.

=head2 Invalid handling of zero-length messages and zero-length PCF strings

Peter Giorgilli reported that we had a bug in the XS code that caused
us to return garbage data when reading zero-length messages.  It turns
out a similar issue caused zero-length PCF strings to be misread for
responses from little-endian queue managers (e.g. Linux/ia32 and
Windows).  These zero-length string bugs have been corrected
throughout all the XS code.

=head2 Rename NoAutoConnect flag for MQSeries::QueueManager constructor

The NoAutoConnect flag for the MQSeries::QueueManager constructor has
been renamed to AutoConnect (with, obviously, reverse meaning of the
option values).  The default behavior remains the same and the next
few releases will support the old flag for backwards compatibility.

=head2 Rename NoAutoOpen flag for MQSeries::Queue constructor

The NoAutoOpen flag for the MQSeries::Queue constructor has been
renamed to AutoOpen (with, obviously, reverse meaning of the option
values).  The default behavior remains the same and the next few
releases will support the old flag for backwards compatibility.

=head2 Add QueueManager method to MQSeries::Queue

In retrospect, it was probably a mistake to add Commit() and Backout()
methods to the MQSeries::Queue class and have them delegate these
calls to the queue manager object.  Some developers were confused by
this and thought the scope of transactions was per-queue.  

However, it is valid to create an MQSeries::Queue object without
creating an MQSeries::QueueManager object first, and Commit() and
Backout() have to be called on something - so it seemed like a
reasonable thing to do.

A new method for MQSeries::Queue, QueueManager(), can be used to
extract the queue manager object from a queue.  The documentation has
been updated to reflect that Commit() and Backout() should be called
on the queue manager object, not on the queue.  The queue-level
Commit() and Backout() methods will be dropped in a future release.

=head1 Changes for 1.16

=head2 MQSeries::Config::ChannelTable

The SYSTEM.DEF.CLNTCONN definition must be present, or the client can
get upset in certain error conditions, so the code now forces this to
the front of the list, even if you don't specify it.

The physical order of the entries, and the order in which the linked
list pointers binds them together, now patches exactly the same
pattern as IBM uses to generate the file on a queue manager.  It is
very possible that noone at Hursley will be able to tell one of my
files from one of theirs. ;-)

And that's a challenge....

=head2 MQSeries::Queue->Set was horrible broken

This was one of those 'how did this ever work?' problems.  The core
was fatally broken.  Fixed.

=head1 Changes for 1.15

=head2 Add 'AFS' principal type to Authority API

The extended PCF API to query/alter Unix authorities now supports a
thirs entity type, 'AFS' (PCF macro MQETE_AFS_GROUP).  As this
requires a modified command server and custom Object Authority Manager
(OAM) only used at Morgan Stanley, this should not affect anyone else.

=head1 Changes for 1.14

=head2 Support for a compare-callback method in CreateObject

The CreateObject method of MQSeries::Command now supports an optional
call-back to perform the comparison of object attributes.  This is
only useful in obscure circumstances.

=head2 Support for StorageClass objects in MQSC commands

The StorageClass object type (as used on the OS/390 version of
MQSeries) is now supported by the MQSeries::Command class.

=head2 MQSeries::Command::Base->GetConvert preserves original message Buffer

In order to add some statistics gathering code to the command API, the
MQSeries::Command::Response objects will not keep the unconverted PCF
data structures in the Buffer attribute of the object, allowing direct
manipulation of the data, of necessary.

We need to be able to measure the absolute size of the original
message, since we are trying to gather metrics on the load placed on
MQSeries systems by administrative tools thatuse this API.

=head2 MQSeries::QueueManager ConnectTimeout logic fixed

This is one of this "how did this ever work?" bugs.

The logic to test the support for fork() in the current perl build was
wrong.  This has been fixed, and the retry logic tested successfully.

=head2 MQSeries::Config::Machine re-parsing bug

This code is clever, and re-parses mqs.ini whenever it changes so that
long running daemons wil automatically detect new queue manager
installation.  However, the method name was incorrect, and this
resulted in a fatal runtime error.  Oops.

=head1 Changes for 1.13

=head2 Support for MQSeries version 5.2 on the mainframe

The MQSeries::Command class now supports MQSeries version 5.2 on the
mainframe.  This includes support for the new QSharingGroup,
CouplingFacility, CommandScope and IntraGroupQueueing keywords; and
the new ResetQueueStatistics method, which returns the same results
as the Unix (PCF) version.  The new DisplayQueueStatus MQSC command is not
yet supported.

Support for MQSeries 5.2 on Unix has also been tested; however, as 
this worked without changes, none were made.

=head2 MQSeries::QueueManager AutoCommit off by default

As warned when we deployed 1.12, MQSeries::QueueManager's AutoCommit
functionality is disabled by default now.  If you want pending
transactions to be automatically committed when your disconnect, you
must set AutoCommit in your code.

=head2 Un-bloat the code

The MQSeries modules were becoming a serious memory hog, largely due
to the import/export of all constants in modules the included
MQSeries.  

The MQSeries moduly now optionally allows importing just the
functions, then referring to constants using an MQSeries:: prefix.
This has been done throughout the MQSeries library internally, leading
to a space saving of some 3 MB for programs using MQSeries::Command.

This change is fully backwards-compatible.  There is no impact on
programs using the MQSeries module, though these can reduce their
memory footprint (if desired) by selectively importing the required
MQSeries functions.

=head2 MQSeries::Command->InquireChannelStatus handles MQRCCF_CHL_STATUS_NOT_FOUND more elegantly

The code has always tried to make a missing channel status appear to
be a successful command, and to return the "ChannelStatus" value of
"NotFound", since this is not really an error.  Unfortunately, we
broke this when we reorganized the MQSeries::Command code for 1.12.

The CompCode and Reason will now be reset to MQCC_OK and MQRC_NONE,
as well as returning a ChannelStatus of "NotFound".

=head2 MQSeries::Message::RulesFormat tolerant of leading whitespace

In the NameValueString of the MQRFH message, that is.  According to
IBM (I checked), there is nothing in the spec or the code of the
pubsub broker(s) that will prohibit the user of leading whitespace in
the MQRFH NameValueString, so the perl API needs to be tolerant of the
same.

=head2 MQSeries::Message::XML-Dumper removed

As this module did not compile, it probably wasn't used by anyone.

=head2 Bug in Extended PCF Command "InquireAuthority" fixed

The keyword in the hash tables used to map strings to PCF macros had a
bug.  Principal was mispelled, causing any query of permissions that
involved principals to fail.

This was guaranteed to impact only MSDW....

=head2 Minor bug in handling of CompCode/Reason values from MQSC Commands

These are really hex values, and we were pretending that they were
decimal.  This generates warning when the values are used for
numerical comparisons.

The CompCode and Reason values are now "eval"ed as hex, and thus
converted to decimal values.

=head2 MQSeries::Command->ReasonText documented

This method returns either the MQReasonToText value for the commandd
reason code, or the ReasonText returned by MQSC.  It wasn't
documented.  It is now.

=head2 MQSeries::Command->CreateObject takes Force argument

You can't pass Force as an object attribute, since it is supported by
ChangeFoo but not by CreateFoo commands, in general.  The
specification of Force is not an argument to CreateObject itself, and
should not be passed as a key in the Attrs hash.

=head1 Changes for 1.12

=head2 MQSeries::Command->Responses

The "Response" method of the MQSeries::Command class conflicts with
the MQSeries::Command::Response class, and this causes headaches in
some code.  The method has been renamed to "Responses".

Now, this is obviously a non-backwards compatible change, however,
that method is very, very rarely used, and this will probably affect
no existing code.  But, you've been warned.

=head2 Support for control of implicitly commited transactions

WARNING: This is a very subtle, but very significant change to the
API.  Anyone using transactions should read and understand the
implications for their application.

Normally, when there are pending tranactions due to uncommited MQPUT()
and/or MQGET() calls, they will be implicitly backed out if the
application crashes.  This is a good thing.  If the application
chooses to cleanly exit, and calls MQDISC() without first calling
MQCMIT(), then the transactions will be implicitly commited.  This is
a good thing, when you do it intentionally.

In the MQSeries::QueueManager object destructor, the code does an
MQDISC() automatically in order to attempt to be a good citizen and
cleanly disconnect from queue manager automatically.  However, if an
application has pending tranactions, and it traps a non-MQSeries
related error and dies, object destruction still occurs, and this
means that the pending transactions will be automatically commited,
often to the surprise of the application developer.

This release offers the developer control of this behavior, via the
new AutoCommit argument to the MQSeries::QueueManager constructor.  If
AutoCommit is disabled, then the object destructor will call MQBACK()
before it calls MQDISC(), if there are pending transactions (the rest
of the code conspires to keep track of this state information for you
automatically, of course).

ANOTHER WARNING: The default behavior is not being changed in 1.12.
AutoCommit will be 1 by default, and transactions will be
automatically commited, in order to be backwards compatible with the
current behavior.  In 1.13, we will change this, since we feel very
strongly that the intuitive behavior should be the default.  If the
application does not explicitly commit transactions, then they will be
backed out when we destroy the MQSeries::QueueManager objects.  

This means that applications will B<NOT> be required to explicitly
call MQBACK() (well, the ->Backout() method, that is) in all of their
error handling.  This is especially important if you call some other
API which itself raises fatal exceptions, since you won't be required
to trap them and take special action.  As of 1.13, we will Do The
Right Thing.

=head2 MQSeries::QueueManager->Connect() timeout logic

Attempts to connect to unhealthy queue managers can often hang
indefinetely, and there is no way for applications to interrupt the
connection, or trap the error.  You simply hang until the queue
manager (or the wedged component) is killed.

The new MQSeries::QueueManager support a ConnectTimeout attributes
which puts a time limit on the MQCONN() call.

=head2 OS/390 Support

The modules now compile and install on OS/390.  See the README file
for version details.

=head2 MQSeries::Config::Authority

A new class under MQSeries::Config, which can be used to parse and query
authority files under Unix.  The 'saveauth' program in the 'examples'
directory shows how this can be used to save all object authorities
in a file of 'setmqaut' commands.

=head2 MQSeries::Command->CreateObject fix: Change, not Create

Actually, this fixes a pretty serious bug.  CreateObject, which is a
wonderfully powerful command, was also rather dangerous, because the
author (er, uh, that would be me -- wpm) got a bit pazy, and just used
the PCF Create commands, with the Replace option.  That works fine if
you are always specifying all or most of the attributes you care
about.  If, however, you provide a subset of the attributes you care
about, the others will get wiped out, since you are giving a sparse
set of attributes to, say, CreateQueue.

The code will now DTRT and use the Change commands if the object
already exists, and Create if it doesn't.  This is far safer, and
makes the code very robust.

=head2 MQSeries::Command->CreateObject fix: Comparing lists

If one of the attributes passed in is a single element ARRAY
reference, it would not compare correctly with a real object attribute
of only one element, since the inquiry API will not return it as an
ARRAY reference unless there are two or more entries.  A single
element ARRAY ref will be flattened to a scalar to make this
comparison correct.

=head2 Limit the max # of open files for MQSeries::FDC::Tail

Some vendors impose a limit of 255 stdio files that can be
open at the same time (though the number of open file descriptors
can be quite a bit higher).  For an queue manager running really
poorly, the number of FDC files being written may be higher than
that, causing perl to die with a "too many open files" error.
The MQSeries::FDC::Tail class will now close and re-open files
in such circumstances (using a least-recently-used approach).

=head2 Support for symbolic Wait and Expiry values

The 'Wait' and 'Expiry' parameters for MQSeries::Command, MQSeries::Queue
and MQSeries::PubSub::Command are specified in units of 1/1000 and 1/10
of a second, making it easy to get the magnitude wrong.  These parameters
can now also be specified as symbolic values, e.g. '45s' for 45 seconds
and '2m' for 2 minutes.

NOTE: These symbolic values work at the API top-level, but not when
you manually create a MsgDesc hash. Low-level values must be specified
in numeric form.

=head2 Use of GetConvert() error checked properly

See the 1.11 changes notes about PutConvert, roughly a page or so
below this.  It was an oversight not to make the analagous changes for
GetConvert as well as PutConvert.

=head2 GetConvertReason() and PutConvertReason() methods added

It is now possible to determine if the failure of a Put(), Put1() or
Get() method calls was a result of a failed PutConvert() or
GetConvert() method, which is called internally by each of the first 3
methods.  

This is important when you want to know if the error was a result of
an improperly formatted message body, or an MQSeries problem.

While some noise gets generated via carp, there was until now no way
to determine this programmatically.

=head2 MQSeries::Command: Support for ordered attributes

The DeleteQueue command has an undocumented dependency on the order of
its optional attributes.  We enhanced the configuration of the PCF
attributes such that we can now specify the order for these
parameters.  Without this change, commands that specified the Purge
option worked half the time, since it was just lucky if perl pulled
the hash entries out in the right order.

Now, we force the parameters to be converted into PCF code in the
correct order.  Currently, this only applies to the Optional
parameters for DeleteQueue, but if we run into any further
undocumented order dependencies, we can accomodate them easily.

=head1 Changes for 1.11

=head2 MQSeries::Config::* classes

Two new classes under MQSeries::Config, specifically Machine and QMgr,
allow read access to the parsed /var/mqm/mqs.ini and
/var/mqm/qmgrs/*/qm.ini files.

=head2 MQSeries::ErrorLog::* classes

Three new classes under MQSeries::ErrorLog, specifically Tail, Parser,
and Entry, allow parsing and monitoring of errorlog files
(/var/mqm/errors/AMQERR0x.LOG, /var/mqm/qmgrs/*/errors/AMQERR0x.LOG).

=head2 MQSeries::FDC::* classes

Three new classes under MQSeries::FDC, specifically Tail, Parser, and
Entry, allow parsing and monitoring of FDC files
(/var/mqm/errors/*.FDC).

=head2 MQSeries::Message::DeadLetter object

A new subclass of MQSeries::Message, which implements parsing of the
MQDLH, has been added to the distribution.  This makes it trivial to
write dead letter queue handler applications in perl.

=head2 Use of PutConvert() error checked properly

We only error check the return value of the PutConvert() method is one
was actually called.  This makes it possible to put empty messages
(where all of the information you care about is in the header, for
example).

=head2 MQSeries::Command->CreateObject method handles lists correctly

This method tries very hard not to alter objects whose attributes are
already correctly set, but the previous version couldn't handle
comparing attributes whose values were lists.  For example, if you
give more than one exit to the MsgExit parameter of a channel, then
the PCF query will return a list of values, and this is represented as
an ARRAY reference.

The new version will correctly compare the array elements, and thus
correctly determine whether or not the attributes with multiple values
are in fact correct.  And yes, order is of course important.

=head2 All GetConvert() methods save raw Buffer

In all of the following modules, the GetConvert() method will save the
raw buffer, which in gives the developer access to the raw,
unconverted data, via the MQSeries::Message->Buffer() method.  

  MQSeries::Message::Storable
  MQSeries::Message::XML-Dumper
  MQSeries::Message::RulesFormat
  MQSeries::Message::DeadLetter (new in 1.11 -- see above)
  MQSeries::Message::PCF

  MQSeries::Command::Response
  MQSeries::PubSub::AdminMessage

A similar change was made to MQSeries::Message::Event, in the 1.09
release, but this has not been done for all of the supported modules
in the distribution, for consistency (and, because the author happened
to need this for MQSeries::Message::Storable).

=head2 MQSeries::PubSub::*, ModelQName DynamicQName configurable

Previously, the name of the permanent dynamic model queue, and dynamic
queue name to be created, were simply hardcoded in the object
constructor for both of

  MQSeries::PubSub::Broker
  MQSeries::PubSub::Stream

Both are now configurable via arguments to the constructor.

=head2 MQSeries::PubSub::AdminMessage->_TranslatePCF

This one is hard to explain.  The code to parse the PCF admin messages
for PubSub wasn't handling multiple subscriber identities correctly.
It does now.  

=head2 MQSeries::Queue->Open() was silent on non-retried errors

There was a missing else condition to carp about an MQOPEN failure, if
the ReasonCode was B<not> in the list of values to be retried.  This
causes significant confusion, since the failure is silent.

=head1 Changes for 1.10

=head2 MQSeries::Command MQSC bugs

Thanks to yet another data length limitation, the string
"INITIALIZING" is too long for OS/390 to display, so this gets
truncated to "INITIALIZI", for output of the InquireChannelStatus()
command, only on that platform.  The API can parse this correctly now.

The IndexType values weren't properly mapped on either requests or
responses.  Now they are.

The HardenGetBackout paremeter was incorrectly encoded in MQSC.  It is
now.

=head2 MQSeries::Message allows BufferLength of 0

This is one that came back to haunt me, as I thought I had fixed this
way back in 1.04.  If you attempt to create an MQSeries::Message with
a BufferLength of zero, you actually get one with the default value of
32K.  This is bad, if you are writing some code to say, browse a queue
and just get all of the headers, as you end up getting some of the
data, too.  The code does the right thing now, and properly accepts a
BufferLength of 0.

=head2 MQSeries::Command->CreateObject enhancements and documentation

I added a new key (Clear) to indicate that when replacing a Local
queue with another QType, the Local queue should be cleared before
being deleted.

There are also a couple of examples in the SYNOPSIS section, and
documentation for the new method call.  This can now be considered
production, and is no longer experimental.  The author uses this call
almost exclusively, in new development, for creating objects.

=head1 Changes for 1.09

=head2 Support for Win32

This release compiles on Windows NT 4.0, and has thus far been tested
with ActiveState 5.00503, build 521, with Visual C++ 6.0.  Other
perl/compiler combinations will probably follow, but the initial
support is all the author has to test.  I've tested it with 5.0 as a
client, and 5.1 as both client and server.

NOTE: (and a WARNING, too).  This code determines where your MQSeries
installation is by querying the Windows Registry, using
Win32::TieRegistry.  This is done not only at compile time (to find
the includes files and shared libs), but also at run time to determine
whether or not to use the client or server API, automatically.

=head2 Retry logic in MQSeries::QueueManager->Connect() and MQSeries::Queue->Open()

The retry logic was always there in MQSeries::QueueManager->Connect(),
but now it is much more configurable.  You can specify which reasons
codes are worth retrying, rather than depend on a hardcoded (and
possibly wrong or incorrect) list.

MQSeries::Queue->Open() also support retry logic, and the author finds
this very useful for daemons recovering from a previous crash,
attempting to open a queue for exclusive input, and waiting for the
previously invoked agent process to free up the input handle.

The documentation for both modules has a RETRY LOGIC section.  See
that for more information, as well as the documentation for the
constructors, and each of the specific methods.

=head2 MQSeries::Command->new takes additional arguments.

The MQSeries::Command constructor takes additional arguments allowing
you to specify the Model Queue, and DynamicQName used to open the
dynamic reply queue for command messages.

=head2 MQSeries::Command->CreateObject() method added

WARNING: This new method, while being Very Cool, is EXPERIMENTAL, and
intentionally not documented, as the API will likely change.  It
will probably stabilize in 1.10.

CreateObject is a higher level wrapper function that will only create
the specified object if it doesn't exist, or the specified attributes
don't match.  This is a conditional object creation, that will be a
noop if the object is already correctly configured.

=head2 MQSeries::QueueManager Hconn reference counting

A global hash, keyed on the process ID, and the Hconn value, will keep
track of how many MQSeries::QueueManager objects have been
instantiated for a given queue manager connections (since the Hconn
values get reused).  The object destructor will now decrement these
values, and only the last object will actually disconnect from the
queue manager.

This is actually a significant enhancement, as it was possible to
pre-maturely disconnect from the queue manager when instantiating lots
of objects, all of them specifying the queue manager by name, and thus
internally recreating lots of MQSeries::QueueManager objects.  The
first one to get destroyed would wipe out the connection, causing
problems for the others.

=head2 MQSeries::QueueManager constructor arguments

The constructor argument QueueManager can now be another
MQSeries::QueueManager argument, and the QueueManager name will be
stolne from that object, and a new one instantiated.  This really just
allows an MQSeries::QueueManager object to be passed to the
MQSeries::PubSub::Broker constructor, actually.

=head2 MQSeries::Queue->Open() ignores the Hobj on errors

The Hobj value returned by MQOPEN() is only saved in the object hash
when the CompCode is either MQCC_OK or MQCC_WARNING.  The value when
there is a failure can be a large, useless negative number, but then
this looks like a true value in perl.

This confuses the subsequent attempts to call ->Open(), which are
supposed to return true if the object is already opened.  This was done via:

	return 1 is $self->{Hobj};

which will be wrong.  This is primarily relevant is you implement any
form of retry logic for failed queue opens.

=head2 MQSeries::Message->Buffer() method added

A new method to return the raw buffer from an MQGET() call.  This is
relevant for classes which use GetConvert() methods to translate the
raw data into a customized form.  If they save the raw buffer into
$self->{Buffer}, then it will be available.

=head2 MQSeries::Message::Event->GetConvert() saves raw Buffer

This GetConvert() method will save the raw buffer, which in this case
gives the developer access to the raw PCF data.  The author uses this
to echo the original event, in its unaltered format, to other systems
management packages, afte rhe gets to it first.

=head1 Changes for 1.08

This is another relatively minor bug fix release, but since I'm
releasing it internally at MSDW, I'm also releasing it to CPAN as
well.

=head2 MQSeries::Message::Event was broken

I made a global variable lexically scoped to its file with an
erroneous "my" keyword.  Don't do that.  The Event parsing class was
totally broken as a result.

=head2 MQSeries::Command error checking enhancement

When a command fails, the Reason() was being set to the last reason
code found in the returned messages, which is always 3008 (command
failed).  Now the code will catch the first non-zero return code, and
default to that, and this reason code is usually the one you want.  

For example, InquireQueue for a non-existent queue name will now
return 2085 (object not found), instead of the generic and
uninteresting 3008.

=head2 MQSeries::QueueManager and MQSeries::Queue constructor bug

Although I don't recommend using this particular interface, the
constructors for both of these classes allow you to pass scalar
references for the Reason and CompCode, so that the MQCONN() or
MQOPEN() errors, if any, can be obtained.  

These were only being set if there was an error, and now they are set
regardless.  Thus, if you initialize the values to, say
MQRC_UNEXPECTED_ERROR and MQCC_FAILED, they will be left that way.

Note that I highly recommend using the NoAutoConnect and NoAutoOpen
arguments, and then error checking the ->Connect() and ->Open()
methods explicitly.  The resulting code is much cleaner, IM!HO.

=head2 MQSeries::Queue->Put() method wasn't setting MQPMO_FAIL_IF_QUIESCING

The various *_FAIL_IF_QUIESCING options are set everywhere by default
(as the author happens to beleive they should be), except here.  This
is fixed.

=head2 MQSeries::PubSub::Broker/Stream API enhanced to support alternate users

In order to enable the development of adminstrative tools for
Publish/Subscribe which allow me to age bogus subscriptions
(i.e. subscriptions that point to non-existent queues), I needed to be
able to DeregisterSubscriber as an alternate user ID.

The API was enhanced to expose a bit more of the underlying method
calls in order to make this possible.  

In addition, several minor bugs in the Administrative PubSub API were
fixed, making it possible to get at almost all of the metatopic
information easily.

=head1 Changes for 1.07

This release is a minor bug fix release, but one of them is
significant enough to justify a public release.

=head2 MQSeries::Message::PCF memory leak

The MQDecodePCF routine didn't properly mortalize the references it
returns.  I hate it when that happens.  The result was that
long-running applications that used the Command API (or any of the
PCF-based formats) heavily (guess what the author was developing when
he discovered this? ;-) will leak memory heavily.  This is fixed.

In addition, the same error was made in the
MQSeries::Message::RulesFormat XS code as well, and that was also
fixed.  

Note that none of the basic MQI interfaces had any problems at all.
There are now no known memory leaks anywhere in the XS code.  We've
had long running perl daemons up for weeks using the basic MQSeries
interface, with no reported issues.

=head2 Change to simplify static compiles

The obnoxious, er, I mean, very important and absolutely essential
legal question about the LICENSE file will be asked only once.  When
compiling statically, the Makefile.PL gets run again, and if it blocks
on input this is not only annoying, but it breaks the static compile.

=head2 Default Expiry values were wrong

The default Expiry values used in the MQSeries::Command API were
incorrect, having the same value as the WaitInterval.  As you probably
know, Expiry is tenths of a second, and Wait is milliseconds.  Oops.

=head1 Changes for 1.06

This release is the first to make it to CPAN (the Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network), as the primary distribution mechanism, rather than
IBM's proprietary Support Pac web site.  In addition, this code is now
copyrighted by MSDW (the author's employer) but released under a
license which is based on the Perl Artistic License.

It is now truly Open Source.  Viva the Revolution, baby...

=head2 MQSeries::PubSub::*

The entire Publish/Subscribe API is new with this release.  This
includes the following modules:

=over 4

=item MQSeries::PubSub::Command

A base class for all of the Publish/Subscribe commands, this module is
not used directly, but rather one of its two subclasses is.

=item MQSeries::PubSub::Broker

This subclass of MQSeries::PubSub::Command, and
MQSeries::QueueManager, implements an interface to the Broker-specific
Publish/Subscribe commands.

This module also supports an set of "Extended Commands", which are
higher level interfaces to the contents of the administrative
inforamtion in the metatopics.

=item MQSeries::PubSub::Stream

This subclass of MQSeries::PubSub::Command, and MQSeries::Queue,
implements an interface to the Stream-specific Publish/Subscribe
commands.

=item MQSeries::PubSub::Message

This subclass of MQSeries::Message::RulesFormat provides an interface
for creating and parsing MQRFH-formated Publish/Subscribe messages.

=item MQSeries::PubSub::AdminMessage

This quasi-subclass (not a *true* OO subclass, but who's looking) of
MQSeries::Message::PCF provides an interface to the Publish/Subscribe
administrative messages published in PCF format.

=back

=head2 MQSeries::Message::PCF

This is a new class which provides a much more generic interface to
PCF messages.  Prior to this release, there were several routines
which parsed implementation-specific formats, with a lot of duplicated
code.

This class can be used directly, but it was primary designed so that
its two core functions (MQEncodePCF and MQDecodePCF) would be used as
building blocks for the implementation-specific formats, such as
Performance Events (MQSeries::Message::Event), Command server requests
and responses (MQSeries::Command::*), and the Publish/Subscribe
administrative messages (MQSeries::PubSub::AdminMessage).

=head2 MQSeries::Message::RulesFormat

This is a new class which provides an interface to the MQRFH Rules and
Format messages used by the Publish/Subscribe system.  This can also
be used to create messages for working with the NEON MQIntegrator 1.X
product suites, since the format is the same, although the author
hasn't actually tried this yet.  

=head2 MQSeries::Message::XML-Dumper

This is a new subclass of MQSeries::Message which encodes/decodes
complex perl data structures using the XML-Dumper module.  This was
mostly done as a proof of principle, and to please some XML zealots.

Note that the parsing of XML is much more expensive than the Storable
approach, and if you have a perl process on the sending and receiving
end of a message flow, the author still recommends using Storable.

This requires the CPAN XML::Dumper and XML::Parser modules.

=head2 MQSeries::Command

=over 4

=item More complete documentation

The various strings used to represent the PCF parameters and values
have finally been documented, so someone other than the author may
actually be able to use this code.

=item Extended to V5.1 PCF Commands

All of the new Commands for V5.1 are supported, and in fact, even if
you compile the MQSeries API with 5.0, you can still use the new
commands, and parse the resulting PCF parameters.  The code which maps
numeric parameters to key strings has been "flattened" such that it
doesn't use the actual C macros.

These files (MQSeries/Command/PCF/*.pl) were auto-generated on an
MQSeries 5.1 host, so the macro-to-number mapping has already been
done, and it is not necessary for the C macro to have been compiled
into constants.c.

=item Extended to V2.1 MQSC Commands

Most, but not all, of the MQSC commands (i.e. commands sent to an
MQSC-only command server, for example an MVS queue manager) have been
supported, and the API can parse all of new V2.1 object attributes
(like "ALTDATE" and "ALTTIME").

WARNING: The MQSC code has not been extensively tested, so use it with
caution.

=back

=head2 MQSeries::QueueManager 

=over 4

=item NoAutoConnect option

The call to MQCONN is normally done in the constructor, but if it
fails, the error checking semantics are ugly.  A new option
(NoAutoConnect) disables the implicit call to ->Connect(), and allows
the developer to make this call, and error check it explicitly.

The Connect() method is also new.

=item Inquire/MQINQ Support

Method calls have added to support the MQINQ() call against the queue
manager itself.  This includes both Open() and Close() methods, which
were not previously available.

The Open() method is also new, although it is just a rename of the
older semi-private _mqopen() method call.

=back

=head2 MQSeries::Queue

=over 4

=item NoAutoOpen option

The call to MQOPEN is normally done in the constructor, but if it
fails, the error checking semantics are ugly.  A new option
(NoAutoOpen) disables the implicit call to ->Open(), and allows the
developer to make this call, and error check it explicitly.

=item Inquire/Set MQINQ/MQSET Support

Method calls have added to support the MQINQ() and MQSET() calls
against queues.  

=item Close method call

Objects can now be explicitly closed.  In previous releases this was
done via the object destructor, and thus couldn't be error checked.
Implicit closing is still preferred, but CloseOptions can be given to
the constructor to control how the object is closed.

This is particularly useful for creating permanent dynamic queues
(which can accept persistent messages) which are purged and deleted
upon close.

=back

=head2 MQSeries core module

=over 4

=item Null-valued macros properly supported

There are several macros, such as MQCI_NONE, which are a fixed length
string of null characters.  These were not properly defined in the
constants.c file, and thus couldn't be used as expected.

Now, these macros all evaluate to a string of nulls of the correct
length, this you can use them precisely as documented in the MQI docs.

=item MQParseEvent, MQCommandRequestPCF, MQCommandResponsePCF and MQParseDeadLetter

These core module subroutines were removed.

MQParseDeadLetter never worked, and it will be implemented
(eventually) in the same way that MQSeries::Message::RulesFormat was
done, with its own XS source file.

The other 3 all dealt with very specific implementations of the PCF
format, and these were replaced by the MQSeries::Message::PCF class,
which provides very generic PCF parsing and encoding routines
(MQEncodePCF and MQDecodePCF).

Mapping the generic PCF into message format specific data is done by
"private" class methods _TranslatePCF in each of the relevant OO
modules.

This was a key prerequisite for developing
MQSeries::PubSub::AdminMessage, which is also based on a PCF message
format.  Future implementations of special formats based on PCF should
be easy.  Of course, now IBM wants to move to XML for everything,
so...

=item MQReasonToStrings

This subroutine's implementation was dramatically reworked.

This used to be implemented in C, inside the XS routine, but now the
hash of key/value pairs mapping a numeric ReasonCode to a readable
test string is done via a pair of automatically compiled files
(MQSeries/Constants/Reason*.pl)

In fact, all of the files in MQSeries/Constants are auto-generated from
templates in src/pre.in, by the tool src/util/flatten_macros.  This is
a huge win, as it basically does the macro-to-value mapping such that
the perl API is dealing with raw numbers.  

There is a non-trivial startup cost otherwise, as each and every macro
has to be looked up in the symbol table, the AUTOLOAD function called,
a C subroutine called, etc.  This saves a few seconds of startup time.

=item XS code streamlined

Most of the non-MQI subroutines were removed entirely, or moved
elsewhere.  The MQSeries.xs.in directory is much more lean.

=item XS code no longer leaks memory

The author now fully understands the XS concepts of mortality and
reference counts, and the code returns correctly mortalized, and
properly reference counted values.  

=item Support for "default" queue manager

The QueueManager key is no longer required by most of the OO API
constructors.  If you have configured a default queue manager for your
environment, then you can use it with the OO API as of this release.
Before, the QueueManager key was required to have a true value, and
since the default queue manager is "", and "" is false...

=back

=head2 Installation Procedures, and other Miscellany

=over 4 

=item 5.004 required, not 5.005

The 5.005 prerequisite was relaxed to 5.004, and the requirement that
the perl interpreter itself be linked directly with -lthread (or
-lpthread, or whatever) was removed.  The MQSeries.so libraries are
themselves compiled with the appropriate dependencies on libthread,
and this code now works fine with a standard, out-of-the-tarball
compile of perl5.004 or later.

=item New CONFIG parameters

It is now possible to explicitly disable either the server or client
API compile.  The Makefile.PL now does a more generic job of
determining whether or not you appear to have support for the server
API, which is the more common case (eg. Linux, SunOS and IRIX only
have client implementations available).

At least one site didn't support clients at all, and they didn't want
to build in the support, so they can now turn it off via CONFIG.

=item MANIFEST and .exclude auto-generated

These files are now auto-generated by development utilities in the
util subdirectory, rather than being updated manually.

=back

=head1 Changes for 1.05

This release required 5.005, built with thread support (this
restriction was subsequently removed in 1.06).

=head2 Installation Procedures

=over 4

=item MQServer::MQSeries made optional

Compilation of the MQServer::MQSeries API is automatically disabled on
SunOS 4.1.3 and IRIX hosts, for which we do not have a server API.

=item constants.c.PL added

The huge, growing list of MQSeries C macros are now extracted from the
MQSeries C include files automatically, and the @EXPORT list is built
dynamically.  The code for constants.c is also auto-generated, and the
code handles several different types of constant (hex, string,
character, etc).

The code also parses all of the available C header files, and makes
all possible macros available.  This makes maintenance of the macro
list easy, but it does result in significant bloat of the namespace
exported by MQSeries.  So be it.

=item Test suite

The test suite was reorganized to a SysV-style rc.d directory syntax,
with files named 10foo.t, 20bar.t, etc.

=back

=head2 MQSeries

=over 4

=item Distribution List Support

Support for Distribution lists was added to the core MQI functions,
such as MQOPEN, MQPUT and MQPUT1.  This required a significant
re-architecture of these functions.  The OO API classes were also
extended to support dist lists as well.

This functionality is all enabled only if one compiles with V5, of
course.

=back

=head2 MQSeries::QueueManager

=over 

=item MQCONN retry logic

The MQCONN retry logic is disabled by default.

=back

=head2 MQSeries::Queue

=over 4

=item MQOPEN retry logic

This was stripped out of the code entirely, since it never really
worked, and I doubt it ever would have.  Bad idea.

=item AutoResize logic

Logic was added to adjust the buffer size automatically, and retry an
MQGET() call, when a truncated message is received, and truncated
messages are not accepted.  This functionality is available in the C++
API, the source of inspiration for the idea.

=back

=head2 MQSeries::Command

=over 4

=item Documentation

This module was finally documented, but only the object constructor
and basic methods were documented.  Complete documentation of the
command syntax was not added until 1.06.

=back

=head1 Changes for 1.04

=head2 MQSeries

Supports explicit loading of MQClient::MQSeries or MQServer::MQSeries,
rather than implicit only.

=head2 MQSeries::Command

Introduce the Command Server API, for both PCF and MQSC command
messages.

=head2 MQSeries::Message::Storable

Uses nfreeze, which is supposed to use network byte order, rather than
freeze.

=head1 Changes for 1.03

=over 4 

=item OO API

First implementation of the OO portion of the API

=item XS source

Eliminated the dual XS file templates, using one source for both V2
and V5

=item MQSeries core

Added two new utility functions to the core API:

    MQParseEvent
    MQReasonToText

=item Locale hacks

MQSeries.pm will automagically set reasonable values for the LANG and
NLSPATH environment variables, if not set.

=item Documentation

Significantly expanded documentation

=back

=head1 Changes for 1.02

=over 4

=item Introduced the extended test suite

=item Dual client/server support

Introduced the dual namespaces to make client vs. server usage
transparent.  That is, MQSeries.pm really pulls in
MQServer/MQSeries.pm on a queue manager, and MQClient/MQSeries.pm
otherwise.

=item PLMQ -> MQSeries

Change the module name from PLMQ to MQSeries, and changed the API
calls from GET to MQGET, etc., making the function mapping one to one.

=item typemap.PL

Automated the typemap generation using a typemap.PL file
