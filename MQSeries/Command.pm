=head1 DESCRIPTION

The MQSeries::Command class implements an interface to the
Programmable Command Format messages documented in the:

  "WebSphere MQ Programmable Command Formats and Administration Interface"

section of the MQSeries documentation.  In particular, this document
will primarily explain how to interpret the above documentation, and
thus use this particular implementation in perl.  Please read and
understand the following sections of the above document:

  Programmable Command Formats
    Chapter . Definitions of the Programmable Command Formats
    Chapter . Structures used for commands and responses

This interface also supports the text-based MQSC format messages used
by the queue manager of some platforms, particularly MVS.  Using the
same interface, either PCF or MQSC command server can be queried, with
the results translated into the same format for responses as well.
Note that there are limits to how transparent this is (see MQSC
NOTES), but the code tries quite hard to hide as many of the
differences as possible.

=head2 COMMAND ARGUMENTS

Before we discuss the specific arguments and return values of each of
the methods supported by the MQSeries::Command module, we must explain
how the keys and values used by the interface were chosen, as this
will allow the developer to understand how to take advantage of the
very complete documentation provided by IBM (which will B<not> be
reproduced here).

For each command documented in 'Definitions of the Programmable
Command Formats' (there is a specific page listing all of the
commands, grouped by type), there is a corresponding method in this
class.  For example, there is a method named 'InquireQueueManager',
for the obvious (I hope) PCF command.

All of these methods take a hash of key/value pairs as an argument,
with the keys being those defined in the documentation for each
command.  When writing C code to produce PCF messages, the parameter
names are macros, such as:

  MQIACF_Q_MGR_ATTRS

to specify a list of queue manager attributes.  Rather than use these
names directly, the key strings are taken from the IBM documentation.
In this example, the string used for this key is:

  QMgrAttrs

The values depend on the structure type of the parameter.  If the
structure is a string (MQCFST), byte string (MQBACF) or an integer
(MQCFIN) then the value of the key is simply a scalar string or
integer in perl.  If it either a string list (MQCFSL) or an integer
list (MQCFIL), then the value of the key is an array reference (see
the InquireQueueManager example in the SYNOPSIS) of scalar strings or
integers.

=head2 RETURN VALUES

Most of the individual methods map to underlying commands which do not
return any data.  For all of these, the return value is simply
Boolean; true or false.  That is, the command either worked or failed.

Only the methods associated with those commands documented as
producing data responses:

  Escape
  Inquire AuthInfo
  Inquire AuthInfo Names
  Inquire Authority Records
  Inquire Authority Service
  Inquire Channel
  Inquire Channel Initiator
  Inquire Channel Listener
  Inquire Channel Listener Status
  Inquire Channel Names
  Inquire Channel Status
  Inquire Cluster Queue Manager
  Inquire Connection
  Inquire Entiry Authority
  Inquire Group
  Inquire Log
  Inquire Namelist
  Inquire Namelist Names
  Inquire Process
  Inquire Process Names
  Inquire Queue
  Inquire Queue Manager
  Inquire Queue Manager Status
  Inquire Queue Names
  Inquire Queue Status
  Inquire Service
  Inquire Service Status
  Inquire Subscription
  Inquire Subscription Status
  Inquire System
  Inquire Topic
  Inquire Topic Status
  Reset Queue Statistics

plus the following equivalents for MQSC

  Inquire CFStruc
  Inquire CFStruc Status
  Inquire Usage
  Inquire Security
  Inquire StorageClass

return interesting information.  Most of these will return an array of
hash references, one for each object matching the query criteria.  For
example.  The specific keys are documented in the section of the IBM
documentation which discusses the "Data responses to commands", on the
summary page "PCF commands and responses in groups".  If you have read
the IBM documentation as requested above, you should have found this
page.

Note that in an array context, the entire list is returned, but in a
scalar context, only the first item in the list is returned.

Some of these commands, however, have a simplified return value.  All
of the below:

  Inquire AuthInfo Names
  Inquire CFStruct Names
  Inquire Channel Names
  Inquire Namelist Names
  Inquire Process Names
  Inquire Queue Names
  Inquire StorageClass Names
  Inquire Topic Names

simply return an array of strings, containing the names which matched
the query criteria.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

The arguments to the constructor are a hash, with the following
key/value pairs:

  Key                Value
  ===                =====
  QueueManager       String or MQSeries::QueueManager object
  ProxyQueueManager  String or MQSeries::QueueManager object
  RealQueueManager   String
  ReplyToQ           String or MQSeries::Queue object
  CommandQueueName   String
  CommandQueue       MQSeries::Queue object
  CommandVersion     Numeric (1 or 3)
  DynamicQName       String
  ModelQName         String
  Type               String ("PCF" or "MQSC")
  Expiry             Numeric
  Wait               Numeric
  ReplyToQMgr        String
  Carp               CODE Reference
  StrictMapping      Boolean

=over 4

=item QueueManager

This argument specifies the queue manager to which commands are to be
sent.

If the 'ProxyQueueManager' argument is specified, this should be the
name of the target queue manager.

If the 'ProxyQueueManager' argument is not specified, this can either
be an C<MQSeries::QueueManager> object, or the name of the Queue
Manager.  Specifying the queue manager name is deprecated and may
stop working in a future release.

The 'QueueManager' argument can be omitted, in which case the "default
queue manager" is assumed.

=item ProxyQueueManager

The name of the queue manager to which to MQCONN(), and submit
messages on the QueueManagers behalf.  This is to be used if a direct
connection to the QueueManager is not possible, for example MVS queue
managers with support for direct client access.

The messages will be put to what is assumed to be a remote queue
definition which routes to the command queue on the desired
QueueManager.

In order to specify the "default" queue manager as the
ProxyQueueManager, an empty string must be explicitly given.

=item RealQueueManager

If a remote queue manager is controlled through a proxy, by having the
C<QueueManager> parameter specify the proxy and the
C<CommandQueueName> an object descriptor, then by default any output
will print the queue manager name incorrectly.  The
C<RealQueueManager> parameter specifies the name used for display
purposes.

=item ReplyToQ

The ReplyToQ can be opened by the application, and the MQSeries::Queue
object passed in to the MQSeries::Command constructor, if so desired,
os, a fixed queue name can be given.  This is a somewhat advanced
usage of the API, since the default behavior of opening a temporary
dynamic queue under the covers is usually prefered, and much simpler.

The responses are retrieved from the reply queue using gets by
CorrelId, so there should be no issue with using a pre-defined, shared
queue for this, if so desired.

=item CommandQueueName

This specifies the queue to which the command messages will be put.
The defaults are usually reasonable, and depend on the command message
Type (PCF or MQSC).

  PCF   => SYSTEM.ADMIN.COMMAND.QUEUE
  MQSC  => SYSTEM.COMMAND.INPUT

If the ProxyQueueManager has been specified, then we assume the
messages are being written to a remote queue definition, and the
defaults are then:

  PCF   => SYSTEM.ADMIN.COMMAND.QUEUE."QueueManager"
  MQSC  => SYSTEM.COMMAND.INPUT."QueueManager"

See "MQSC NOTES" for some examples of how to use this in practice.

Alternatively, the C<CommandQueue> parameter can be used.

=item CommandQueue

For complex set-ups, where a remote queue manager is managed by the
name of the command queue does not fit the standard scheme, the
command queue can be opened manually and specified in the
MQSeries::Command constructor as the C<CommandQueue> parameter.

The C<CommandQueue> parameter must be combined with the
C<RealQueueManager> parameter.  In the example below, a mainframe
queue manager C<CSQ1> is managed from the queue manager C<UNIXQM> with
a non-standard queue name:

    $queue = MQSeries::Queue::->
      new('QueueManager' => 'UNIXQM',
          'Queue'        => 'REMOTE.FOR.COMMANDQ.ON.CSQ1',
          'Mode'         => 'output',
         ) ||
      die "Cannot open queue";

    $cmd = MQSeries::Command::->
      new('ProxyQueueManager' => 'UNIXQM', # Also ReplyToQMgr
          'RealQueueManager'  => 'CSQ1',   # Displayed in messages
          'Type'              => "MQSC",
          'CommandQueue'      => $queue,
         ) ||
      die "Cannot create command";

If both queue managers run MQ v6, then PCF commands can be used to
communicate with MQ on z/OS.  The above example would be changed as
follows to use PCF commands:

    $cmd = MQSeries::Command::->
      new('ProxyQueueManager' => 'UNIXQM', # Also ReplyToQMgr
          'RealQueueManager'  => 'CSQ1',   # Displayed in messages
          'Type'              => 'PCF',
          'CommandVersion'    => MQCFH_VERSION_3,
          'CommandQueue'      => $queue,
         ) ||
      die "Cannot create command";

This mechanism can also be used when the command queue needs to be
opened with special options.  This is typically combined with a call
to the C<MsgDesc> method:

    my $queue = MQSeries::Queue::->
      new('QueueManager' => 'UNIXQM',
          'Queue'        => 'SYSTEM.ADMIN.COMMAND.QUEUE',
          'Options'      => (MQOO_FAIL_IF_QUIESCING |
                             MQOO_OUTPUT |
                             MQOO_SET_IDENTITY_CONTEXT,
                            ),
         ) ||
      die "Cannot open queue";

    $cmd = MQSeries::Command::->
      new('RealQueueManager' => 'UNIXQM',
          'Type'             => 'PCF',
          'CommandQueue'     => $queue,
         ) ||
      die "Cannot create command";

    $cmd->MsgDesc('ApplIdentityData' => "MyData",
                  'UserIdentifier'   => "mqm",
                 );

=item CommandVersion

This argument is introduced mainly to support the new PCF commands in
MQ v6 (such as FilterCommand filter options) and to use PCF with
QueueManagers on OS/390. It indicates the required PCF Command Version
(MQCFH_CURRENT_VERSION) and Type. This is an optional argument and
Version "1" is used as default. If a value '3' or higher is specified,
then the Command Type "MQCFT_COMMAND_XR" will be used and also the
version is set to "MQCFH_CURRENT_VERSION". Any value less then 3 will
be ignored and the defaults are used (MQCFT_COMMAND and default
version).

=item Type

This argument indicates whether the command server on the QueueManager
supports either PCF or MQSC messages.  The default is PCF.  See the
section "MQSC NOTES" for the Ugly Truth about the MQSC support.

=item Expiry

This value is used as the MQMD.Expiry field on all requests sent to
the command server.  The value is passed to the MQSeries::Message
constructor, and should specify the time in B<tenths of a second>.
The default is 600, or 60 seconds.

A symbolic value ending on 's' for seconds or 'm' for minutes may
also be specified, e.g. the symbolic value '45s' will have the same
meaning as the number 450.

=item Wait

This value is used as the Wait argument to the MQSeries::Queue->Get()
method call made against the ReplyToQ (a dynamic reply queue). and
should be a time specified in B<milliseconds>.  The default is 60000,
or 60 seconds.

A symbolic value ending on 's' for seconds or 'm' for minutes may
also be specified, e.g. the symbolic value '45s' will have the same
meaning as the number 45000.

NOTE: Both the Expiry and Wait defaults may be too slow for heavily
loaded queue managers.  Tune them appropriately.

=item ReplyToQMgr

The ReplyToQMgr normally defaults to the QueueManager, but it can be
overridden, perhaps as a means of specifying an alternate return path
over a specific channel.  For example, the author uses special
channels for SYSTEM related traffic, over which we forward MQSeries
events from one queue manager to another, and also over which we wish
the command server queries to flow.

The "default" path between QMA and QMB flows over a channel called
QMA.QMB, but this traffic is application data, not administrative
system data.  The system queries flow over QMA.QMB.SYSTEM, and we need
to ensure that replies to queries follow a similar reverse path.
Specifying the ReplyToQMgr as "QMB.SYSTEM" accomplishes this.

=item Carp

This key specifies a code reference to a routine to replace all of the
carp() calls in the API, allowing the user of the API to trap and
handle all of the error message generated internally, or simply
redirect how they get logged.

For example, one might want everything to be logged via syslog:

  sub MyLogger {
      my ($message) = @_;
      foreach my $line (split(/\n+/, $message)) {
          syslog("err", $line);
      }
  }

Then, one tells the object to use this routine:

  my $command = MQSeries::Command->new(
                                       QueueManager => 'some.queue.manager',
                                       Carp => \&MyLogger,
                                      )
      or die("Unable to connect to queue manager.\n");

The default, as one might guess, is Carp::carp();

=item StrictMapping

If this argument has a true value, then strict mapping of PCF
parameters and values will be enforced.  Normally, if you feed a bogus
string into the API, it will attempt to map it to the underlying PCF
macro value, and if the mapping fails, it will quietly forgive you,
and ignore the parameter.  Enabling this feature will cause the
translation of an encoded PCF message into the data structure for a
Response, or the translation of a Request into an encoded PCF message,
to fail if any of the mappings fail.

Usually, the command server will generate errors if you feed bogus
data into the API. but that will only occur after the data has been
encoded and sent to the command server.  This feature will allow you
to detect this error before the data is ever sent.

=back

=head2 CompCode

This method will return the MQI CompCode for the most recent MQI call
made by the API.

=head2 Reason

This method will return the MQI Reason for the most recent MQI call
made by the API.

=head2 ReasonText

This method will return different strings depending on whether the
command is MQSC or PCF.  For MQSC, the command server sends back some
text explaining the reason code, and for PCF, we simply call
MQReasonToText on the reason code and return that instead.

MQSC sends back far less information encoded into the reason than PCF
does, and the interesting information is usually found in the
ReasonText.  Therefore, this method should be used when raising
exceptions, in order to get the most descriptive explanation for any
given error.

=head2 Responses

Normally, the data of interest is returned from the method in
question, but the individual responses are available via this method.
This returns a list of MQSeries::Command::Response objects, one for
each individual message recieved.

=head2 DataParameters

This method will return a list of parameters structures from all of
the responses messages sent back which were B<not> error responses.
Some errors will send back responses with parameters, and these could
easily be confused with real data (until you start looking at the
actual data, of course).

=head2 ErrorParameters

This method will return a list of parameters structures from all of
the responses messages sent back which B<were> error responses.  If a
command fails, the Reason() will usually tell you enough about the
cause of the failure, but if the reason is MQRCCF_CFIN_PARM_ID_ERROR,
then the parameters in the error message will indicate which Parameter
key was invalid.

=head2 MsgDesc

In some cases, it is useful or necessary to override specific MQMD
fields in outgoing request messages.  Examples include manually
changeing the Persistence field, or changing the message identity or
origin context.  The MsgDesc method allows you to do so:

  $cmd->MsgDesc('Persistence' => 0);

or

  $cmd->MsgDesc('ApplIdentityData' => "MyData",
                'UserIdentifier'   => "mqm",
               );

Note that setting the message identity or origin context requires you
to open the command queue with the relevant open options; see the
description of the C<CommandQueue> parameter to C<new>.

Note that the C<ReplyToQ>, C<ReplyToQMgr> and C<Expiry> fields for the
request message descriptor can be specified in the constructor C<new>.
The C<MsgDesc> method is intended for the more obscure options.

=head2 CreateObject

This is a generic "wrapper" method for creating any generic MQSeries
object.  The arguments to this method are a hash, with the following
key/value pairs:

  Key                Value
  ===                =====
  Attrs              HASH reference
  Verify             Boolean
  Clear              Boolean
  Quiet              Boolean
  Force              Boolean
  Callback           CODE reference

The key/value pairs in the Attrs argument are passed directly to the
corresponding CreateQueue(), CreateChannel(), or CreateProcess()
method.  However, there is more to this than just creating the object.
For clarity, this discussion will use creation of a queue as an
example.

First, InquireQueue is called to see if the object already exists.  If
it does not exist, then the object is simply created, with the
specified attributes.

If it does exist, and the QType matches, then the actual object
attributes are compared against those passed to the CreateObject
method, and if they match, then no action is taken, and the object is
not modified.

If it does exist, but of a different QType, then the existing object
is deleted, and the new object created as requested.

The idea here is to match the modification of the object conditional
on the need for modifying the object.  If the same CreateObject method
call, with the same arguments, is called twice, then the second method
invocation should be a noop, as far as the actual MQSeries object is
concerned.

=over

=item Attrs

As discussed above, this is a HASH reference, whose key/value pairs
are used to determine what type of object is being created or updated,
and those key/value pairs are passed as-is to the appropriate Create*
method call for the specified MQSeries object type.

=item Verify

If this key has a true value, then no changes will actually be
implemented.  They will merely be reported via test messages on
stdout.

=item Quiet

CreateObject is by default rather chatty about what it is doing, but
all of the messages, other than errors, can be suppressed if this key
has a true value.

=item Clear

Normally, when a Local queue is being replaced with another QType
(eg. Remote or Alias), then the Local queue is not cleared before
being deleted.  If there are messages on the queue, this will cause an
error.  If the queue needs to be cleared, then this key must be passed
with a true value.

This is a seperate option due to the inherit danger of destroying data
accidentally.  If you really want to clear the queues before
recreating them as another QType, you will have to be explicitl about
it.

=item Force

This option will be passed to the Change* method, if the object
already exists and is of type Queue, forcing changes to be applied to
objects which are currently in use.  It is ignored for the other
object types.  Note that this should B<not> be passed as a key to the
Attrs hash, since this is not really an object attribute.

If Force is given as an Attrs key, and the underlying Create* method
is called, since the object does not already exist, then the command
server will return an error.

=item Callback

This optional argument allows you to provide an object comparison
subroutine, instead of relying on the built-in function.  This is
virtually never required, unless your request contains some 'meta'
attributes that translate to multiple or different MQSeries
attributes.

The C<Callback> parameter must be a reference to a subroutine that
receives three parameters: a reference to the requested attributes, a
reference to the attributes found in the object, and a reference to a
subroutine that compares two single attribute values.  The return
value from the subroutine must be a reference to a hash with those
attribute names and values that actually should be changed.

Please see the source code of C<MQSeries::Command>, specifically the
C<_CompareAttributes> method, for the default callback.  Any callback
you provide must behave in a similar way.

=back

=head1 COMMAND REQUESTS

This section is B<NOT> intended to replace the IBM "MQSeries
Programmable System Management" documentation, and it merely serves to
document the specific keys and values used by the perl implementation
of the API.

In all cases, the keys which can be passed to the command are
identical to the strings found in the documentation.  However, some of
the values also have more convenient string mapping as well, as these
are not easily intuited by reading IBMs docs, thus these are clarified
here.

The IBM docs list the possible values for each key as a list of
MQSeries C macros (eg. MQCHT_SENDER), and if given, these will be
respected.  It will be faster to use the strings given, since these
map directly to the actual macro values via a hash lookup, rather than
a function call (all of the various C macros are implemented as
function calls via an AUTOLOAD).  Also, the author finds the
replacement strings far more readable.  YMMV.

For each key shown, the format of value is one of the following:

=over 4

=item (string)

The value given must be a scalar value, interpretable as a text
string.

=item (string list)

The value must be an ARRAY reference of scalar values, all of which
must be interpretable as strings.

NOTE: Some of the parameters (for example, the MsgExit parameter for
the various Channel commands) can take either a string or string list.
In this case, the API will be forgiving, and try to determine what you
meant automatically.  If you pass a reference, it will create a string
list parameter, and if you pass a plain scalar, it will create a
string.

ANOTHER NOTE: if you pass a simple scalar string where a string list
is explicitly required (as opposed to optional), then the API will
create a list of one string for you.

=item (integer)

The value given must be a scalar value, interpretable as an integer.
In some cases, a table will show a mapping from more readable text
strings to the macros documented in the IBM manuals.

=item (integer list)

The value must be an ARRAY reference of scalar values, all of which
must be interpretable as integers.  As with the integer format, in
some cases, a table will show a mapping from more readable text
strings to the macros documented in the IBM manuals.

=item (Boolean)

The value given need only be 0 or 1.  This was done for some of the
integer types which are documented to take a pair of macros, whose
values were simply zero or one, and when the true/false nature of the
key was considered to be intiuitive.  For example, "DataConversion" is
either on (true) or off (false).

=head1 COMMAND RESPONSES

There are several commands which return data.  The return value of the
actual command methods depends on the specific command.  All of the
"Inquire*Names" commands return a list of the actual names returned,
which greatly simplifies the parsing of the return value.

For example:

  @qnames = $command->InquireQueueNames( QName => 'FOO.*' );

will result in @qnames containing a list of strings of all of the
queue names starting with FOO.

The rest of the commands return a list of Parameters HASH references,
extracted from each of the messages sent back from the command server.
In a scalar context, only the first Parameters HASH reference is
returned. Refer to the L</RETURN VALUES> section for the list of
commands.

For example:

  @queues = $command->InquireQueue( QName => 'FOO.*', QAttrs => 'All' );

will result in @queues containing a list of HASH references, each of
which has key/value pairs for the attributes of one of the queues
starting with FOO.

The keys in the Parameters HASH references are mapped from the numeric
macro values back into the same strings described above for
simplifying the input Parameters.

However, there are a few keys in the responses which are not supported
as keys in the inquiry.  In general, the return values are left
unmolested.

=head1 FILTERS

For PCF requests to MQ v6 and above, filter commands can be used to
have the queue manager filter out only objects of interest.  For
example, you can inquire for queues with a certain maximum message
length, for connections from specific IP addresses, or for queue
status with a minimum queue depth.

Filters require that the command object is created with CommandVersion
3, i.e.

  $command = MQSeries::Command::->
    new('QueueManager'   => 'SOME.QUEUE.MANAGER',
        'Type'           => 'PCF',
        'CommandVersion' => MQCFH_VERSION_3);

Following that, most Inquire commands accept an optional FilterCommand
parameter that specifies an attribute to filter on, a comparison
operator, and a value.  (See the IBM documentation for which Inquire
commands support filters.)

The filter can be specified in pseudo-SQL syntax, e.g. :

  @queues = $command->
    InquireQueue('FilterCommand' => "QName like 'SYSTEM.PE*'");
  @queues = $command->
    InquireQueue('FilterCommand' => "MaxQDepth > 10000");

Alternatively, if the value used contains quotes, or if the filter is
constructed dynamically, the filter can be specified as a hash
reference:

  @queues = $command->
    InquireQueue('FilterCommand' => { Parameter => 'MaxQDepth',
                                      Operator  => '>',
                                      Value     => 100_000,
                                    });

The supported filter parameters (field names) are almost any field
returned by the Inquire command (see the IBM documentation for
details).  The supported value can be an integer, string, string
wildcard (a value ending on a '*'), or (for enumerated types) the
constant name as returned by the Inquire command.  For example, for an
enumerated type, to query for alias queues that have a rmote queue as
their base type:

  @queues = $command->
    InquireQueue('FilterCommand' => "BaseType == Remote");

The operators supported depend on the parameter type.  All types
support equal (==) and unequal (<>, !=); numeric types also support
the numeric comparators (<, >, <=, >=); string types support 'like'
and 'not like' with a wildcard value ending on '*'; integer list types
support 'contains' and 'excludes'; and string list types support
'contains', 'excludes', 'contains_gen' and 'excludes_gen', where the
latter to values perform a wildcard comparison.  The examples below
illustrate supported usage.

  BaseType == Local
  BaseType <> Local
  BytesSent > 10000
  CurrentQDepth > 10000
  Msgs <= 100
  ConnectionName like '144.14.*'
  BaseQName not like 'SYSTEM.*'
  HeaderCompression contains 'gzip'
  HeaderCompression excludes 'gzip'

Note that the filter is not evaluated as a perl expression.  The
MQSeries::Command class parses the expression into a parameter,
operator and value; then converts the value to the appropriate type (a
value lookup for enumerated types, a conversion to integer for
numbers, and conversion to string for strings).  In other words, the
expected amount of DWIM is in place.
