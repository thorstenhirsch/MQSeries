#
# The FDC logs are watched based on the following assumptions:
# - The initial data in the FDC files is of no interest (just updates)
# - Files may grow
# - New files can be added at any time
# - Log-management scripts may truncate FDC files down to zero bytes
#   at any time
# - If a file inode changes, the previous file is of no interest
#

#
# Constructor
#
# Parameters:
# - Class name
# - Directory to watch
# - Max # of files this is allowed to open at any one time
#   (defaults to 200)
# Returns:
# - New MQSeries::FDC::Tail object

=head1 NAME

MQSeries::FDC::Tail -- Watch MQSeries FDC error files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use MQSeries::FDC::Tail;

  my $fdc_log = new MQSeries::FDC::Tail("/var/mqm/errors");
  while (1) {
      my @entries = $fdc_log->process();
      process_fdc_entries(@entries) if (@entries);
      sleep(10) unless (@entries);
  }

  sub process_fdc_entries {
      my (@fdc_entries) = @_;

      foreach my $entry (@fdc_entries) {
          # Send off to syslog or whatever
      }
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The MQSeries::FDC::Tail class provides a mechanism to watch the FDC
logs, which are generally written to if a fatal MQSeries error, or
internal MQSeries error, occurs.

Every time the process() method is invoked, it will return a (possibly
empty) array of MQSeries::FDC::Entry objects, which can in turn be
analyzed and shipped off to syslog or other monitoring tools.

The MQSeries::FDC::Tail class will notice new FDC files appearing;
files being truncated (e.g. by housekeeping jobs) or files being
removed.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Create a new MQSeries::FDC::Tail object. The argument is the directory
to watch (/var/mqm/errors for a typical installation).  An optional
second argument specifies the maximum number of files that may be open
at the same time; the default is 200, well under the default limit of
255 open files imposed by the stdio libraries of many vendors.

=head2 process

Process any changes since the previous invocation (or the
constructor).  Read any data found, parse it and return the
MQSeries::FDC::Entry objects that were read.
