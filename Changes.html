<h1 id="Introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>This file documents the changes to each and every release of the MQSeries perl API, going back as far as the 1.02 release.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.35">Changes for 1.35</h1>

<p>Makefile.PL and util/parse_headers: Multiple definition of MQI_BY_VALUE_STR error fixed, even though this seems like a bug in a new header file that comes with MQ v8</p>

<p>MQSeries/Properties.pm: Object destructor (DESTROY) required valid Hconn, but Hconn might have been removed, causing &quot;MQDLTMH failed&quot; error with reason 2018.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.34">Changes for 1.34</h1>

<p>MQClient/typemap.PL will handle MQINT64 like how it handles MQHMSG.</p>

<p>MQSeries/Comamnd/Base.pm: In untraslatePCF, the filters handled properly. Filters may also apply to MQCFT_INTEGER64 and MQCFT_INTEGER64_LIST as well as the shorter kinds.</p>

<p>MQSeries/Command.pm : Added support for ChlAuth and Comminfo objects of mqv7.1.</p>

<p>MQSeries/ErrorLog/Parser.pm: addied a &#39;ip.ad.dre.ss (port)&#39; parser for the error log</p>

<p>MQSeries/ErrorLog/descriptions.pl: Allow single-character hostnames. more likely this is the first character of an ip address where the first octet is a single digit. Add AMQ6048 for dbcs error.</p>

<p>MQSeries/Message/RFH2.pm : Modified based CPAN user&#39;s input. It handles NameValueData correctly. Also sets the default Format to MQFMT_NONE instead of undef.</p>

<p>util/parse_headers: Some defines are now both compound (ie, they are multiple macros |&#39;ed together) and the last one ends in L, so the check for the former must move above the check for the latter so that it works with 7.1 string leading and trailing spaces from or&#39;ed values. This makes the postponed parsing of or&#39;ed defines work, where the or&#39;ed define has spaces inside the parentheses.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.33">Changes for 1.33</h1>

<h2 id="Major-work-on-Statistics-messages-and-PCF-types">Major work on Statistics messages and PCF types</h2>

<p>Support for the decoding of MQ v6 Accounting/Statistics messages was added to the PCF decoder, along with the new types these messages use. Though not strictly necessary, support for these types (MQCFT_GROUP, MQCFT_INTEGER64, and MQCFT_INTEGER64_LIST) is intended to be complete throughout the PCF framework, so encoding should work as well.</p>

<p>New message subtypes MQSeries::Message::Accounting and MQSeries::Message::Statistics were added for this, both of which are derived from the new MQSeries::Message::System class, which mainly exists to handle the decoding of the messages. The already existing MQSeries::Message::Event class was reparented to here.</p>

<h2 id="MQSC-and-PCF-enhancements">MQSC and PCF enhancements</h2>

<p>The encoding/decoding for KeepAliveInterval has been addressed, and support for more PCF and MQSC commands have been added, and more MQ v7 items and types were included as well. This should make the administration of a z/OS queue manager more complete.</p>

<p>Note that as a part of this, the CreateAuthInfo and ChangeAuthInfo commands now require the AuthInfoType parameter which was previously optional.</p>

<h2 id="Minor-tweaks">Minor tweaks</h2>

<p>MQSeries::Queue now allows a queue to be called &quot;0&quot;. Previously this was mistaken to be a false value (ok, it is, but it&#39;s also a defined and non-zero-length string, so you should be able to use it).</p>

<p>MQSeries::Command was mixing up the DefinitionType setting on queues when creating or updating local and model queues. In particular, you may end up with a PermDyn model queue where this is wrong, or the failure to delete a dynamic queue, in order to recreate as a local queue.</p>

<p>MQSeries::QueueManager now explicitly sets the get/put counters it keeps to 0. This is to eliminate messages of the form:</p>

<pre><code>    Currently  puts and 3 gets pending</code></pre>

<p>where the number of &quot;puts&quot; is simply missing.</p>

<p>An old bug in MQSeries::Message::PCF was removed (wrt the Header and Parameters methods) once the new MQSeries::Message::System class was added. It was completely wrong, so clearly no one had used it before now. It&#39;s better now. An old memory leak in MQEncodePCF in PCF.xs was also squashed (affected parties may have noticed a slow but continuing increase in memory size of a process that was sending lots of PCF messages).</p>

<h2 id="Important-note-for-MQv5-and-perl-5.6-users">Important note for MQv5 and perl 5.6 users</h2>

<p>With the addition of the MQ v6 Statistics and Accounting support in this release, as well as the new PCF stuff, the possibility exists that the MQSeries perl module no longer supports either MQ v5 or perl 5.6. Support for these will be at a best effort kind of basis, but with the caveat that the maintainers no longer use either of these amy will likely not be able to replicate anything close to an environment involving either of this if you have any problems.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.32">Changes for 1.32</h1>

<p>The following fixes are included in the 1.32 release:</p>

<h2 id="ReasonQualifier-Macro-Translation">ReasonQualifier Macro Translation</h2>

<p>Markus Sonderegger requested MQReasonQualifierToStrings(), MQReasonQualifierToMacro(), and MQReasonQualifierToText() functions (and the associated hashes) to translate the ReasonQualifier values to something more human-friendly.</p>

<h2 id="SSL-Improvements">SSL Improvements</h2>

<p>SSLPeerName is now handled as part of the ClientConn passed to MQCONNX(), and also when passed as part of a channel definition when writing a channel table file.</p>

<p>More SSL-related event types are now defined.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-fix-for-InquireChannelNames">MQSeries::Command fix for InquireChannelNames</h2>

<p>Investigation of a problem report with InquireChannelNames led to the discovery of a gap between the documentation and server-side implementation of InquireChannelNames. Channel names are now taken from the last PCF response instead of the first on the grounds that that one is much more likely to contain the actual answer.</p>

<h2 id="Portability-Better-code">Portability / Better code</h2>

<p>Some types were adjusted to better match the places where they are used and to avoid compiler warnings from some platforms/compilers. Similarly, some C++ style comments were changed to C comments so that pre-C99 compilers will be happy.</p>

<p>The MQHMSG type is now translated to/from a perl type better.</p>

<p>Macros that are defined to enable backwards compatible building against older MQ installs are now wrapped in #ifdef/#endif to avoid compiler warnings.</p>

<p>The hex() function is now used to translate stringified hexadecimal into a number instead of eval(). Fix suggested by an anonymous well-intentioned problem ticket.</p>

<p>A number of places in the code path for generation of a channel table could lead perl to emit warnings about undef. Reasonable defaults have been applied to eliminate these.</p>

<p>The test for MQSTAT() has been updated to match the current state of the art.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-fix-for-CreateObject">MQSeries::Command fix for CreateObject</h2>

<p>CreateObject() would fail to create a local queue if a dynamic queue already existed with the same name because they have the same QType (a previously existing remote queue would be deleted first because the QType is different). Now we also check the DefinitionType to see if a dynamic queue should be replaced with a local queue.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.31">Changes for 1.31</h1>

<p>The following fixes are included in the 1.31 release:</p>

<h2 id="XS-code-cleanup">XS code cleanup</h2>

<p>Fix support for builds on Solaris, and a few places where filters weren&#39;t completely supported properly. Add some type casts to quiet some compiler warnings, and a workaround for non-C99 systems.</p>

<h2 id="Minor-bugfixes">Minor bugfixes</h2>

<p>Adjust the projected test count for one script to match the number of tests, fix an undefined variable use warning in MQSeries/Command.pm, and a parameter validation inaccuracy in MQSeries/QueueManager.pm.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.30">Changes for 1.30</h1>

<p>The following changes are included in the 1.30 release:</p>

<h2 id="Support-for-properties-MQ-v7">Support for properties (MQ v7)</h2>

<p>The low-level API and the MQSeries::XXX classes have been extended with support for properties. There is a new MQSeries::Properties class and the existing MQSeries::Queue and MQSeries::Message classes have been extended with new methods.</p>

<h2 id="Support-for-asynchronous-put-status-information-MQ-v7">Support for asynchronous put status information (MQ v7)</h2>

<p>The low-level API and the MQSeries::QueueManager class have been extended with support for asynchronous put status information. In the low-level API, the function is MQSTAT; in the MQSeries::QueueManager class, the method is StatusInfo.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-enhancements-for-MQ-v7">MQSeries::Command enhancements for MQ v7</h2>

<p>The MQSeries::Command class now supports the new MQ v7 attributes for PCF commands on distributed platforms, i.e. it supports querying and modifying the new queue manager, queue and channel attributes introduced with MQ v7. Support for Topic and Subscription objects has been added to MQSeries::Command.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-enhancements-to-support-filter-commands">MQSeries::Command enhancements to support filter commands</h2>

<p>The MQSeries::Command class now supports filter commands for MQ v6 and above. This allows Inquire commands to include a filter that is evaluated by the queue manager and reduces the result set to items matching the filter (query).</p>

<h2 id="XS-code-cleanup1">XS code cleanup</h2>

<p>Significant cleanups in the low-level XS code should make it possible to run with warnings enabled without getting large numbers of &quot;use of uninitialized value&quot; messages at run-time.</p>

<h2 id="Updated-examples">Updated examples</h2>

<p>The example scripts have been updated; most notably, a new set of request/reply scripts demonstrates handling syncpoint, poison messages, and dynamic queues.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.29">Changes for 1.29</h1>

<p>The following fixes are included in the 1.29 release:</p>

<h2 id="Initial-support-for-MQ-v7">Initial support for MQ v7</h2>

<p>The module now compiles with MQ v7 and new constants are supported. Support for new and enhanced APIs is not yet in place. During configuration, some warnings will occur for unknown datatypes. This is expected and can be ignored.</p>

<p>Feedback on which MQ v7 features should be supported in the next module release is welcome.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-fixes">MQSeries::Command fixes</h2>

<p>Minor changes for queue-sharing groups and for the HeaderCompression/MessageCompression attributes.</p>

<h2 id="Support-SecurityParms-in-MQCONNX">Support SecurityParms in MQCONNX</h2>

<p>Duke Nguyen contributed support for the SecurityParms data structure with the MQCONNX call</p>

<h2 id="SSL-tutorial">SSL tutorial</h2>

<p>Morten Bjoernsvik contributed a cookbook on using SSL with the MQSeries client and server.</p>

<h2 id="Minor-bugfixes1">Minor bugfixes</h2>

<p>Morten Bjoernsvik contributed a bugfix to the MQSeries::Queue module, avoiding a call to MQCLOSE if no queue manager connection exists.</p>

<h2 id="ChannelTable-fixes">ChannelTable fixes</h2>

<p>Recent V6 client releases are more picky in how they parse v4 channel table files (the format native to the MQ 5.0 client release). The MQSeries::Config::ChannelTable file has been updated to reflect this.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-fixes1">MQSeries::Command fixes</h2>

<p>Add the missing ChannelStatistics attribute for Channel commands.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.28">Changes for 1.28</h1>

<p>The following fixes are included in the 1.28 release:</p>

<h2 id="Compilation-fixes-when-used-with-MQ-v5">Compilation fixes when used with MQ v5</h2>

<p>The changes for release 1.27 broke MQSeries::Command when used with an MQ v5 client.</p>

<h2 id="Fix-client-server-detection-on-Windows">Fix client/server detection on Windows</h2>

<p>Patrick Lanners supplied a patch to improve the testing for the client or server API on Windows.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.27">Changes for 1.27</h1>

<p>The following fixes are included in the 1.27 release:</p>

<h2 id="New-entries-in-the-AMQERR0x.LOG-parser">New entries in the AMQERR0x.LOG parser</h2>

<p>A number of additional message descriptions have been added to the configuration file for the AMQERR0x.LOG parser (MQSeries::ErrorLog::Parser). The newly supported messages are specific to MQ v6 on Linux/Unix/Windows.</p>

<p>The AMQERR0x.LOG parser does not yet support all new MQ v6 messages. Error reports (including AMQERR0x.LOG files) are welcome.</p>

<h2 id="Other-changes-made">Other changes made:</h2>

<ul>

<li><p>Updated MQSC command attributes for OS/390 WMQ6 queue managers.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Added/Updated PCF commands/attributes for both Mainframe and Distributed queue managers.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Added support for BYSTRING parameters like ConnectionId.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.26">Changes for 1.26</h1>

<p>The following fixes are included in the 1.26 release:</p>

<h2 id="Updated-entries-for-AMQ9001-and-AMQ9002">Updated entries for AMQ9001 and AMQ9002</h2>

<p>IBM has changed the AMQERR log format for the above codes. Updated descriptions.pl file in the Errorlog directory.</p>

<h2 id="Correct-the-RequestParameterOrder-for-SetAuthorityRecord">Correct the RequestParameterOrder for SetAuthorityRecord</h2>

<p>Thanks to &quot;Jean-Yves Baudy [jy.baudy@free.fr]&quot; for pointing this out. Corrected the RequestParameterOrder file to expect the correct order.</p>

<h2 id="Fix-the-InquireChannelStatus-PCF-command">Fix the InquireChannelStatus PCF command</h2>

<p>Updated the ChannelStatus block in RequestParameters file with all the necessary optional parameters.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.25">Changes for 1.25</h1>

<p>The 1.24 release, though long-delayed, was plagued by glitches. Our only excuse is that it had been too long since the last release and we were out of practice. Let&#39;s hope the 1.25 release is better.</p>

<h2 id="Add-missing-generated-files">Add missing generated files</h2>

<p>The MQSeries 1.24 release accidentally went out without the required generated files. This has been corrected.</p>

<h2 id="Fix-link-RPATH-glitches-on-64-bit-Linux">Fix link RPATH glitches on 64-bit Linux</h2>

<p>The RPATH for 64-bit linux systems ended up as /opt/mqm/lib6464 due to duplicate addition of the &#39;64&#39; postfix. This has been fixed.</p>

<h2 id="Remove-vestigial-MQ-v2-and-OS-390-support">Remove vestigial MQ v2 and OS/390 support</h2>

<p>Support for the MQ v2 release has been removed. The lowest supported MQ release is now 5.2 and the lowest supported perl release is now perl 5.6.</p>

<p>In a similar manner, the incomplete and known to be broken OS/390 support is removed. The module will still work with z/OS queue managers; it just won&#39;t try and compile on OS/390 anymore.</p>

<h2 id="Remove-outdated-PubSub-support">Remove outdated PubSub support</h2>

<p>Support for the outdated pre-MQSI v2 publish/subscribe classes (MQSeries::PubSub, MQSeries::Message::RulesFormat) has been removed.</p>

<h2 id="Switch-to-Params::Validate">Switch to Params::Validate</h2>

<p>The VerifyNamedParams method in the MQSeries::Utils has been dropped and is replaced by the use of the Params::Validate module. This is a new dependency that must be installed before the MQSeries module.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.24">Changes for 1.24</h1>

<h2 id="Add-support-for-MQ-v6-in-MQSeries::Command">Add support for MQ v6 in MQSeries::Command</h2>

<p>Support for all new parameters in PCF and MQSC commands; support for mainframe PCF commands; and several new PCF commands such as <code>InquireQueueManagerStatus</code>, <code>InquireUsage</code> and the authority-related commands.</p>

<h2 id="Fix-a-bug-in-MQSeries::Config::QMgr">Fix a bug in MQSeries::Config::QMgr</h2>

<p>Monique Diaz reported a bug in MQSeries::Config::QMgr, where re-parsing a changed queue manager config file would lead to an incorrect method invocation.</p>

<h2 id="Fix-documentation-for-Carp-parameter">Fix documentation for Carp parameter</h2>

<p>Herb Williams reported that the examples for the &#39;Carp&#39; parameter were broken. They should now make more sense and actually work.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.23">Changes for 1.23</h1>

<h2 id="New-MQSeries::Message::RFH2-class">New MQSeries::Message::RFH2 class</h2>

<p>A new class to support RFH2 messages; this allows interaction with JMS clients and the various WMQ Integrator products.</p>

<p>This message type is experimental and lightly tested (bugreports and patches welcome). Thanks to Tim Kimber for working on this.</p>

<h2 id="Support-for-NonPersistentMsgClass">Support for NonPersistentMsgClass</h2>

<p>The new queue attribute <code>NonPersistentMsgClass</code>, which is available for Local and Model queues starting with WMQ 5.3 CSD06, is now supported by MQSeries::Command::PCF and MQSeries::Command::MQSC.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.22">Changes for 1.22</h1>

<h2 id="Support-for-the-MQ-Client-on-Linux-Itanium">Support for the MQ Client on Linux / Itanium</h2>

<p>Add 64-bit client support for Linux / Itanium. This should also make it easy to add support for other 64-bit clients - but note that each scuh platform will need to adjust the util/parse_headers script. Patches for other platforms are welcome.</p>

<h2 id="Support-for-SCO-OpenServer-MQSeries-5.0">Support for SCO OpenServer / MQSeries 5.0</h2>

<p>Leonid Lisovskiy contributed patches to make the MQSeries module compile on SCO OpenServer 5.0.6 using the WillowTech MQSeries 5.0 client.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-fixes2">MQSeries::Command fixes</h2>

<p>Support IndexType &quot;GroupId&quot; for shared queues on z/OS in MQSeries::Command::MQSC.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.21">Changes for 1.21</h1>

<h2 id="Fixes-for-MQSeries::Message::IIH">Fixes for MQSeries::Message::IIH</h2>

<p>Jeff Dunn contributed patches to the IMBS Bridge Header class MQSeries::Message::IIH that make it work on both little-endian and big-endian platforms. By default, the module assumes client and server will run on platforms with the same endian-ness; this can be overridden if this is not the case.</p>

<h2 id="Fix-for-MQSeries::Queue-Get-failure-with-MQRC_FORMAT_ERROR">Fix for MQSeries::Queue Get() failure with MQRC_FORMAT_ERROR</h2>

<p>When a message has format MQFMT_NONE; sender and receiver run on platforms with different endian-ness; and the receiver specifies Get-Message Option MQGMO_CONVERT; then MQ returns completion code MQCC_WARNING and reason code MQRC_FORMAT_ERROR.</p>

<p>The MQSeries::Queue Get() method used to treat this as an error. In this particular case (Format MQFMT_NONE), the warning can be ignored. The method now treats this as a succesful read.</p>

<h2 id="Use-version-2-of-MQMD-MQGMO-MQPMO-by-default">Use version 2 of MQMD, MQGMO, MQPMO by default</h2>

<p>The MQGET, MQPUT and MQPUT1 functions now use MQMD version 2 and MQGMO version2 by default; MQPUT and MQPUT1 now use MQPMO version2 by default if a distribution list is specified. Applications using message grouping, segmentation, or distribution lists no longer have to specify the MsgDesc, GetMsgOpts or PutMsgOpts version explicitly.</p>

<p>It is still possible to set a higher MQMD, MQGMO or MQPMO version explicitly. Note that this change will break use of older (pre-5.0) queue managers, but as these are over 5 years out of date, this should not matter.</p>

<h2 id="Handle-too-short-input-data">Handle too-short input data</h2>

<p>Howard Muten noted that specifiying a too-short correlation id on MQPUT resulted in garbage bytes written to MQ. This turned out to be a generic problem, where user-supplied data that was too short was copied in with whatever memory contenst was following. This has been fixed in the typemap code.</p>

<h2 id="Add-support-for-SSL-connect-options-to-MQCONNX-and-MQSeries::QueueManager">Add support for SSL connect options to MQCONNX and MQSeries::QueueManager</h2>

<p>Brian Bumpass contributed XS code to add support for the SSLConfig options to the <code>MQCONNX</code> call, as well as support for the additional ClientConn parameters introduced in WMQ 5.3. These options have also been added to the MQSeries::QueueManager class. Use of these options obviously requires a WMQ 5.3 client with the optional SSL support installed and configured.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-supports-direct-mainframe-connectivity">MQSeries::Command supports direct mainframe connectivity</h2>

<p>The MQSeries::Command class now supports connecting directly to the mainframe (z/OS) using client connections. As the default syncpoint behavior on MQPUT for this platform is different, this module now explicitly specifies MQPMO_NO_SYNCPOINT when writing a message.</p>

<h2 id="Improve-support-for-WMQ-5.3-queue-sharing-groups">Improve support for WMQ 5.3 queue-sharing groups</h2>

<p>On the mainframe (z/OS), WMQ 5.3 supports queue-sharing groups. The MQSeries::Command::MQSC classes have been extended to support the following features:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Add the &#39;Shared&#39; option to the queue DefinitionType parameter values</p>

</li>
<li><p>In CreateObject(), do not alter the object but delete and recreate it when either the QSharingGroupDisposition or CFStruct attributes has changed.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Support-for-V7-channel-tables-in-MQSeries::Config::ChannelTable">Support for V7 channel tables in MQSeries::Config::ChannelTable</h2>

<p>Mike Surikov contributed further patches to support reading and writing of channel table files, including fields new with version 7 of this file (WMQ 5.3). Generation and parsing of the older versions is still supported.</p>

<h2 id="Alter-link-libraries-for-AIX">Alter link libraries for AIX</h2>

<p>James FitzGibbon contributed some configure options for Makefile.PL to pick the right MQ libraries on AIX.</p>

<h2 id="Drop-deprecated-options-methods-for-MQSeries::Queue">Drop deprecated options, methods for MQSeries::Queue</h2>

<p>The deprecated option <code>NoAutoOpen</code> for the MQSeries::Queue constructor <code>new</code> is no longer supported.</p>

<p>The deprecated MQSeries::Queue methods <code>Commit</code>, <code>Backout</code> and <code>Pending</code> are no longer supported. Obviously, these methods are still supported on the MQSeries::QueueManager object.</p>

<h2 id="Drop-deprecated-option-for-MQSeries::QueueManager">Drop deprecated option for MQSeries::QueueManager</h2>

<p>The deprecated option <code>NoAutoConnect</code> for the MQSeries::QueueManager constructor <code>new</code> is no longer supported.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.20">Changes for 1.20</h1>

<h2 id="Improve-MQSeries::Command::PCF-support-for-clusters">Improve MQSeries::Command::PCF support for clusters</h2>

<p>Minor fixes for the <code>InquireClusterQueueManager</code> command; add support for <code>RefreshCluster</code> command. At this time, support for <code>ResetCluster</code>, <code>SuspendQueueManagerCluster</code> and <code>ResumeQueueManagerCluster</code> is not planned (patches are welcome).</p>

<h2 id="Support-file-handles-in-writeFile-for-MQSeries::Config::ChannelTable">Support file handles in writeFile() for MQSeries::Config::ChannelTable</h2>

<p>T. Rob Wyatt requested the ability to write to a caller-supplied filehandle in the MQSeries::Config::ChannelTable <code>writeFile</code> method; this allows him to supply channel tables from a CGI script without having to create temporary files.</p>

<p>Support for this is now provided using the new <code>FileHandle</code> parameter to the <code>writeFile</code> method.</p>

<h2 id="Support-for-V6-channel-tables-in-MQSeries::Config::ChannelTable">Support for V6 channel tables in MQSeries::Config::ChannelTable</h2>

<p>Mike Surikov contributed patches to support reading and writing of version 6 client channel table files. Previous releases did not handle all fields. The default version of files written is now version 6, though generation and parsing of the older version format is still supported.</p>

<h2 id="New-MQSeries::Message::Trigger-class">New MQSeries::Message::Trigger class</h2>

<p>A new class to support trigger monitor messages; this allows you to write a trigger monitor in perl.</p>

<h2 id="Alter-link-libraries-for-Linux-and-HP-UX">Alter link libraries for Linux and HP-UX</h2>

<p>On Linux and HP-UX, the MQ libraries are different for single- and multi-threaded programs. The makefile now tries to pick the right libraries based on the &#39;usethread&#39; parameter in Config.pm.</p>

<h2 id="Fix-the-MQSeries::Command-Escape-method">Fix the MQSeries::Command-&gt;Escape() method</h2>

<p>Mike Surikov supplied a patch that makes the &#39;Escape&#39; method of MQSeries::Command work. This is used when sending MQSC commands using PCF.</p>

<h2 id="Deprecated-parameters-generate-a-warning">Deprecated parameters generate a warning</h2>

<p>The deprecated parameters <code>NoAutoConnect</code> for <code>MQSeries::QueueManager</code> and <code>NoAutoOpen</code> for <code>MQSeries::Queue</code> will generate a run-time warning whether -w is enabled or not. In the next release, the warning becomes a fatal error.</p>

<h2 id="Deprecated-methods-generate-a-warning">Deprecated methods generate a warning</h2>

<p>The deprecated <code>MQSeries::Queue</code> methods <code>Commit</code>, <code>Backout</code> and <code>Pending</code> will generate a run-time warning whether -w is enabled or not. In the next release, the warning becomes a fatal error.</p>

<h2 id="Drop-old-platforms-and-releases">Drop old platforms and releases</h2>

<p>This release drops support for MQSeries 5.0, Solaris 2.5.1 and IRIX. We have not made any changes to the code that should affect these platforms and releases, but no longer have hese host types around. If you care about these platforms, we&#39;ll be happy to merge patches to keep them working.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.19">Changes for 1.19</h1>

<h2 id="API-change-for-Get-Put-methods-of-MQSeries::Queue">API change for Get/Put methods of MQSeries::Queue</h2>

<p>In previous releases, specifying the <code>PutMsgOpts</code> with the <code>Put</code> method or the <code>GetMsgOpts</code> with the <code>Get</code> method of <code>MQSeries::Queue</code> meant that <code>Sync</code>, <code>Wait</code> and <code>Convert</code> parameters were ignored.</p>

<p>This has now changed: the <code>Sync</code>, <code>Wait</code> and <code>Convert</code> parameters will be honored and be combined with the get/put options specified with the <code>PutMsgOpts</code> or <code>GetMsgOpts</code> parameters.</p>

<p>The <code>Get</code> method <code>Wait</code> and <code>Convert</code> parameters will override the <code>GetMsgOpts</code> options flag.</p>

<p>The <code>Get</code> and <code>Put</code> method <code>Sync</code> paramater will check the <code>GetMsgOpts</code> or <code>PutMsgOpts</code> options flag for compatibility. If a coflicting syncpoint option is already set, a fatal error will be raised. If no conflicting option is set (this means the options flkag either has no syncpoint flag set at all, or has the requested flag set already), the requested <code>Sync</code> paramater will be added to the options flag.</p>

<p>This means the following will now work:</p>

<pre><code>    my $result = $request_queue-&gt;
      Get(&#39;Message&#39;    =&gt; $get_message,
          &#39;GetMsgOpts&#39; =&gt;

<p>In the past, this would cause the <code>Wait</code> flag to be silently ignored.</p>

<p>This incompatible API change may break your code. As it significantly enhances the safety of your code, this is deemed a price worth paying.</p>

<h2 id="New-MQSeries::Message::ConfigEvent-class">New MQSeries::Message::ConfigEvent class</h2>

<p>WebSphere MQ 5.3 on z/OS can generate configuration change events that cannot be read on Unix and NT queue managers - distributed queue managers are not able to convert PCF version2 messages. The MQSeries::Message::ConfigEvent class can be used to process such messages - highly useful to create an audit log.</p>

<h2 id="New-MQSeries::Message::IIH-class">New MQSeries::Message::IIH class</h2>

<p>A new class to support IMS Bridge Header (IIH) messages. This is due to Nathan Dupra of Xerox USA. This class is based on reverse engineering and somewhat experimental - feedback on functionality or the API is welcome.</p>

<h2 id="Add-support-for-WebSphere-MQ-5.3-on-z-OS">Add support for WebSphere MQ 5.3 on z/OS</h2>

<p>A number of minor changes have been made to support MQSeries::Command with the 5.3 release (now branded WebSphere MQ) on z/OS. Note that PTF UQ68236 is required - the MQSC output of &quot;Display Queue&quot; is invalid without that PTF, leading to errors with the <code>InquireQueue</code> method.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Support for AuthInfo objects in <code>MQSeries::Command</code>, mostly through changes in the <code>MQSeries::Command::MQSC::*</code> tables.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Support for CFStruct (Coupling Facility Application Structure) objects in <code>MQSeries::Command</code>, mostly through changes in the <code>MQSeries::Command::MQSC::*</code> tables.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Support for the new Channel attributes in <code>MQSeries::Command</code>, mostly through changes in the <code>MQSeries::Command::MQSC::*</code> tables. The new attributes are <code>BatchHeartBeat</code>, <code>KeepAliveInterval</code>, <code>LocalAddress</code>, <code>SSLCipherSpec</code>, <code>SSLClientAuth</code> and <code>SSLPeerName</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Support for the new QueueManager attributes in <code>MQSeries::Command</code>, mostly through changes in the <code>MQSeries::Command::MQSC::*</code> tables. The new attributes are <code>ConfigurationEvent</code>, <code>ExpiryInterval</code>, <code>SSLKeyRepository</code>, <code>SSLCRLNamelist</code>, <code>SSLCryptoHardware</code> and <code>SSLTasks</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Support for the new Queue attributes in <code>MQSeries::Command</code>, mostly through changes in the <code>MQSeries::Command::MQSC::*</code> tables. The new attribute is <code>PageSetId</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Support for the new Namelist attributes in <code>MQSeries::Command</code>, mostly through changes in the <code>MQSeries::Command::MQSC::*</code> tables. The new attribute is <code>NamelistType</code>.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="New-features-for-MQSeries::Command">New features for MQSeries::Command</h2>

<p>The <code>MQSeries::Command</code> constructor now accepts a <code>CommandQueue</code> parameter. This allows you to open an arbitrary queue with arbitary options, then use it so send commands.</p>

<p>In addition, a new <code>MsgDesc</code> method for <code>MQSeries::Command</code> can be used to fine-tune the message descriptor for outgoing commands.</p>

<p>These new features can be used to open an arbitarry queue and override message persistence, as some users requested; internally, we sue it to set the accounting options on outgoing messages, which are then archived by the WMQ 5.3 configuration events on z/OS.</p>

<h2 id="Better-decoding-of-MQSC-results">Better decoding of MQSC results</h2>

<p>Mike Surikov pointed out more bugs in the decoding of MQSC result messages in <code>MQSeries::Command</code>. I&#39;ve added more fixes...</p>

<h2 id="Parameter-verification-for-MQSeries::QueueManager">Parameter verification for MQSeries::QueueManager</h2>

<p>The parameters to the major methods of the <code>MQSeries::QueueManager</code> class (<code>new</code>, <code>Connect</code>, <code>Close</code>) are now enforced. Specifying invalid parameter names will lead to a fatal run-time error.</p>

<h2 id="Parameter-verification-for-MQSeries::Queue">Parameter verification for MQSeries::Queue</h2>

<p>The parameters to the major methods of the <code>MQSeries::Queue</code> class (<code>new</code>, <code>Open</code>, <code>Get</code>) are now enforced. Specifying invalid parameter names will lead to a fatal run-time error.</p>

<h2 id="New-Convert-option-for-MQSeries::Queue-Get-method">New &#39;Convert&#39; option for MQSeries::Queue Get method</h2>

<p>The <code>Get</code> method of <code>MQSeries::Queue</code> has a new <code>Convert</code> option. This is true by default, but can be set to false if conversion is not required. This is useful when manually converting messages, e.g. WMQ 5.3 configuration events.</p>

<h2 id="Deprecated-parameters-generate-a-warning-if--w-is-enabled">Deprecated parameters generate a warning if -w is enabled</h2>

<p>The deprecated parameters <code>NoAutoConnect</code> for <code>MQSeries::QueueManager</code> and <code>NoAutoOpen</code> for <code>MQSeries::Queue</code> will generate a warning if -w is enabled. In the next release, the warning becomes mandatory.</p>

<h2 id="Deprecated-methods-generate-a-warning-if--w-is-enabled">Deprecated methods generate a warning if -w is enabled</h2>

<p>The deprecated <code>MQSeries::Queue</code> methods <code>Commit</code>, <code>Backout</code> and <code>Pending</code> will generate a warning if -w is enabled. In the next release, the warning becomes mandatory.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.18">Changes for 1.18</h1>

<h2 id="Add-support-for-WebSphere-MQ-5.3">Add support for WebSphere MQ 5.3</h2>

<p>A number of minor changes have been made to support the 5.3 release (now branded WebSphere MQ).</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The format of AMQERR01.LOG files has changed: the record separator can now contain a filename and line. Update to <code>MQSeries::ErrorLog::Parser</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The product name in many message in the AMQERR01.LOG file has changed; some error messages have been added and others have minor changes. Update to <code>MQSeries::ErrorLog::descriptions.pl</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The format of FDC files has changed: the product name at the start of each record has changed. Update to <code>MQSeries::FDC::Parser</code>, which now supports both the old and the new product name.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Support for AuthInfo objects in <code>MQSeries::Command</code>, mostly through changes in the <code>MQSeries::Command::PCF::*</code> tables.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Support for the new <code>InquireQueueStatus</code> command, mostly through changes in the <code>MQSeries::Command::PCF::*</code> tables.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Support for the new Channel attributes in <code>MQSeries::Command</code>, mostly through changes in the <code>MQSeries::Command::PCF::*</code> tables. The new attributes are <code>BatchHeartBeat</code>, <code>LocalAddress</code>, <code>SSLCipherSpec</code>, <code>SSLClientAuth</code> and <code>SSLPeerName</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Support for the new QueueManager attributes in <code>MQSeries::Command</code>, mostly through changes in the <code>MQSeries::Command::PCF::*</code> tables. The new attributes are <code>ConfigurationEvent</code>, <code>SSLKeyRepository</code>, <code>SSLCRLNamelist</code> and <code>SSLCryptoHardware</code>.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Support-ChannelTable-reading-writing-on-Windows-NT">Support ChannelTable reading/writing on Windows NT</h2>

<p>Jim Wendorf reported that the <code>MQSeries::Config::ChannelTable</code> file did not reliably read and write channel tables on Windows NT. This was due to missing binmode() statements and sort order issues and has now been fixed.</p>

<h2 id="Improved-client-server-API-detection">Improved client/server API detection</h2>

<p>Edwin Haswell contributed code for improved client vs server API support. The plain &quot;use MQSeries;&quot; code should now work again for client installations.</p>

<h2 id="Add-support-for-MQSC-InquireQueueStatus-command">Add support for MQSC InquireQueueStatus command</h2>

<p>The <code>MQSeries::Command</code> class now supports the <code>InquireQueueStatus</code> command when using MQSC commands. This works against mainframe queue managers running MQSeries release 5.2 and up.</p>

<h2 id="Remove-support-for-perl5.004">Remove support for perl5.004</h2>

<p>The MQSeries module now requires perl5.005. We test internally with both perl5.005 and perl5.6.</p>

<h2 id="Strict-argument-checking-for-MQSeries::Command-constructor">Strict argument checking for MQSeries::Command constructor</h2>

<p>The MQSeries::Command constructor now performs strict parameter name validation and will throw an exception (using confess()) if an invalid parameter name is passed.</p>

<p>This has the potential of breaking existing, but buggy, code. Similar changes will be made to many of the other classes and methods in upcoming releases.</p>

<h2 id="Modified-message-retry-handling-in-MQSeries::Queue-Get">Modified message retry handling in MQSeries::Queue Get()</h2>

<p>Paul Meekin submitted an interesting bug showing we got message retry wrong when the initial data buffer is too large and message conversion is required (reason code MQRC_TRUNCATED_MSG_FAILED). Effectively, we were re-using the MQMD returned after the warning, which caused the requested coded character set and encoding to be ignored. This is now fixed.</p>

<p>However, this bug also showed that some of the retry logic was non-functional; the non-working code has now been removed. The retry logic failed in the following (rare) corner-case:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>You are getting a string message and requesting conversion</p>

</li>
<li><p>The data buffer specified is large enough to hold the message before conversion</p>

</li>
<li><p>The message expands during conversion (e.g., Latin-1 to UTF-8)</p>

</li>
<li><p>The data buffer specified is not large enough to hold the message after conversion</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>It turns out that in this case (when MQCC_WARNING and MQRC_CONVERTED_STRING_TOO_BIG is returned) is not retryable. The only thing the application can do, if the message was read under syncpoint, is to roll back and try again with a properly sized data buffer.</p>

<h2 id="Reduced-memory-usage-for-MQSeries::Command">Reduced memory usage for MQSeries::Command</h2>

<p>The MQSeries::Command module will now delay loading for the sub-classes MQSeries::Command::PCF and MQSeries::Command::MQSC until either one is actually used. Under most circumstances, this will save a substantial amount of memory. Apache mod_perl users may want to pre-load the relevant sub-class as part of their startup script.</p>

<h2 id="Support-for-ClientConn-options-with-MQCONNX">Support for ClientConn options with MQCONNX</h2>

<p>Hirosi Taguti noted that the MQCONNX call did not properly support client-connection options. After he persisted in his bug reports for a year, we finally fixed it - which required adding some XS code. Note that the syntax for the ClientConn options may be different than expected, as the MQCNO &#39;versions&#39; and &#39;Options&#39; flags must also be accomodated:</p>

<pre><code>  $HConn = MQCONNX($QmgrName, 
                   { &#39;ClientConn&#39; =&gt; { &#39;ChannelName&#39;   =&gt; &#39;FOO&#39;,
                                       &#39;TransportType&#39; =&gt; &#39;TCP&#39;,
                                       &#39;ConnectionName&#39; =&gt; &quot;hostname(1414)&quot;,
                                     },
                   },
                   $CompCode, 
                   $Reason);</code></pre>

<p>The <code>MQSeries::QueueManager</code> class now uses MQCONNX and supports an optional <code>ClientConn</code> parameter to specify these options.</p>

<h2 id="Support-MQ-5.2-CSD03-and-CSD04">Support MQ 5.2 CSD03 and CSD04</h2>

<p>Various people noted that MQSeries 5.2 CSD03 and CSD04 caused a number of tests to break. This is because the various header files now provide two different values for various constants, depending on whether you compile in 32-bit mode or 64-bit mode. As we are not running a full C pre-processor, that broke the constant parsing.</p>

<p>We now support these changed header files, though we do not yet support the 64-bit client mode on Solaris (patches are welcome).</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.17">Changes for 1.17</h1>

<h2 id="Parameter-order-for-PCF-commands">Parameter order for PCF commands</h2>

<p>Jim Hildebrand at MQ Software tried to use the MQSeries::Command suite on Windows 2000 and discovered that the order in which PCF command options are specified was dependent on the platform hash key ordering, even though the PCF command server requires a specific ordering for some keys. The perl hash key ordering happened to work on Solaris, but broke on Windows 2000 (and possibly other platforms).</p>

<h2 id="Final-message-for-mainframe-MQSC-commands">Final message for mainframe MQSC commands</h2>

<p>Joseph Sacco at Starwood Hotels reported that the MQSeries::Command suite, when run against a mainframe using MQSC commands, gave annoying errors messages because the terminating response line on his mainframe queue manager has a different format from ours.</p>

<p>We now accept both formats. If you run MQSeries::Command against a mainframe and get error messages like:</p>

<pre><code>    Unrecognized MQSC buffer: /T2 CSQMDRTS &#39; DISPLAY QUEUE&#39; NORMAL COMPLETION</code></pre>

<p>then please get in touch and send us the error message.</p>

<h2 id="Invalid-handling-of-zero-length-messages-and-zero-length-PCF-strings">Invalid handling of zero-length messages and zero-length PCF strings</h2>

<p>Peter Giorgilli reported that we had a bug in the XS code that caused us to return garbage data when reading zero-length messages. It turns out a similar issue caused zero-length PCF strings to be misread for responses from little-endian queue managers (e.g. Linux/ia32 and Windows). These zero-length string bugs have been corrected throughout all the XS code.</p>

<h2 id="Rename-NoAutoConnect-flag-for-MQSeries::QueueManager-constructor">Rename NoAutoConnect flag for MQSeries::QueueManager constructor</h2>

<p>The NoAutoConnect flag for the MQSeries::QueueManager constructor has been renamed to AutoConnect (with, obviously, reverse meaning of the option values). The default behavior remains the same and the next few releases will support the old flag for backwards compatibility.</p>

<h2 id="Rename-NoAutoOpen-flag-for-MQSeries::Queue-constructor">Rename NoAutoOpen flag for MQSeries::Queue constructor</h2>

<p>The NoAutoOpen flag for the MQSeries::Queue constructor has been renamed to AutoOpen (with, obviously, reverse meaning of the option values). The default behavior remains the same and the next few releases will support the old flag for backwards compatibility.</p>

<h2 id="Add-QueueManager-method-to-MQSeries::Queue">Add QueueManager method to MQSeries::Queue</h2>

<p>In retrospect, it was probably a mistake to add Commit() and Backout() methods to the MQSeries::Queue class and have them delegate these calls to the queue manager object. Some developers were confused by this and thought the scope of transactions was per-queue.</p>

<p>However, it is valid to create an MQSeries::Queue object without creating an MQSeries::QueueManager object first, and Commit() and Backout() have to be called on something - so it seemed like a reasonable thing to do.</p>

<p>A new method for MQSeries::Queue, QueueManager(), can be used to extract the queue manager object from a queue. The documentation has been updated to reflect that Commit() and Backout() should be called on the queue manager object, not on the queue. The queue-level Commit() and Backout() methods will be dropped in a future release.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.16">Changes for 1.16</h1>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Config::ChannelTable">MQSeries::Config::ChannelTable</h2>

<p>The SYSTEM.DEF.CLNTCONN definition must be present, or the client can get upset in certain error conditions, so the code now forces this to the front of the list, even if you don&#39;t specify it.</p>

<p>The physical order of the entries, and the order in which the linked list pointers binds them together, now patches exactly the same pattern as IBM uses to generate the file on a queue manager. It is very possible that noone at Hursley will be able to tell one of my files from one of theirs. ;-)</p>

<p>And that&#39;s a challenge....</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Queue-Set-was-horrible-broken">MQSeries::Queue-&gt;Set was horrible broken</h2>

<p>This was one of those &#39;how did this ever work?&#39; problems. The core was fatally broken. Fixed.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.15">Changes for 1.15</h1>

<h2 id="Add-AFS-principal-type-to-Authority-API">Add &#39;AFS&#39; principal type to Authority API</h2>

<p>The extended PCF API to query/alter Unix authorities now supports a thirs entity type, &#39;AFS&#39; (PCF macro MQETE_AFS_GROUP). As this requires a modified command server and custom Object Authority Manager (OAM) only used at Morgan Stanley, this should not affect anyone else.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.14">Changes for 1.14</h1>

<h2 id="Support-for-a-compare-callback-method-in-CreateObject">Support for a compare-callback method in CreateObject</h2>

<p>The CreateObject method of MQSeries::Command now supports an optional call-back to perform the comparison of object attributes. This is only useful in obscure circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="Support-for-StorageClass-objects-in-MQSC-commands">Support for StorageClass objects in MQSC commands</h2>

<p>The StorageClass object type (as used on the OS/390 version of MQSeries) is now supported by the MQSeries::Command class.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command::Base-GetConvert-preserves-original-message-Buffer">MQSeries::Command::Base-&gt;GetConvert preserves original message Buffer</h2>

<p>In order to add some statistics gathering code to the command API, the MQSeries::Command::Response objects will not keep the unconverted PCF data structures in the Buffer attribute of the object, allowing direct manipulation of the data, of necessary.</p>

<p>We need to be able to measure the absolute size of the original message, since we are trying to gather metrics on the load placed on MQSeries systems by administrative tools thatuse this API.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::QueueManager-ConnectTimeout-logic-fixed">MQSeries::QueueManager ConnectTimeout logic fixed</h2>

<p>This is one of this &quot;how did this ever work?&quot; bugs.</p>

<p>The logic to test the support for fork() in the current perl build was wrong. This has been fixed, and the retry logic tested successfully.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Config::Machine-re-parsing-bug">MQSeries::Config::Machine re-parsing bug</h2>

<p>This code is clever, and re-parses mqs.ini whenever it changes so that long running daemons wil automatically detect new queue manager installation. However, the method name was incorrect, and this resulted in a fatal runtime error. Oops.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.13">Changes for 1.13</h1>

<h2 id="Support-for-MQSeries-version-5.2-on-the-mainframe">Support for MQSeries version 5.2 on the mainframe</h2>

<p>The MQSeries::Command class now supports MQSeries version 5.2 on the mainframe. This includes support for the new QSharingGroup, CouplingFacility, CommandScope and IntraGroupQueueing keywords; and the new ResetQueueStatistics method, which returns the same results as the Unix (PCF) version. The new DisplayQueueStatus MQSC command is not yet supported.</p>

<p>Support for MQSeries 5.2 on Unix has also been tested; however, as this worked without changes, none were made.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::QueueManager-AutoCommit-off-by-default">MQSeries::QueueManager AutoCommit off by default</h2>

<p>As warned when we deployed 1.12, MQSeries::QueueManager&#39;s AutoCommit functionality is disabled by default now. If you want pending transactions to be automatically committed when your disconnect, you must set AutoCommit in your code.</p>

<h2 id="Un-bloat-the-code">Un-bloat the code</h2>

<p>The MQSeries modules were becoming a serious memory hog, largely due to the import/export of all constants in modules the included MQSeries.</p>

<p>The MQSeries moduly now optionally allows importing just the functions, then referring to constants using an MQSeries:: prefix. This has been done throughout the MQSeries library internally, leading to a space saving of some 3 MB for programs using MQSeries::Command.</p>

<p>This change is fully backwards-compatible. There is no impact on programs using the MQSeries module, though these can reduce their memory footprint (if desired) by selectively importing the required MQSeries functions.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-InquireChannelStatus-handles-MQRCCF_CHL_STATUS_NOT_FOUND-more-elegantly">MQSeries::Command-&gt;InquireChannelStatus handles MQRCCF_CHL_STATUS_NOT_FOUND more elegantly</h2>

<p>The code has always tried to make a missing channel status appear to be a successful command, and to return the &quot;ChannelStatus&quot; value of &quot;NotFound&quot;, since this is not really an error. Unfortunately, we broke this when we reorganized the MQSeries::Command code for 1.12.</p>

<p>The CompCode and Reason will now be reset to MQCC_OK and MQRC_NONE, as well as returning a ChannelStatus of &quot;NotFound&quot;.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Message::RulesFormat-tolerant-of-leading-whitespace">MQSeries::Message::RulesFormat tolerant of leading whitespace</h2>

<p>In the NameValueString of the MQRFH message, that is. According to IBM (I checked), there is nothing in the spec or the code of the pubsub broker(s) that will prohibit the user of leading whitespace in the MQRFH NameValueString, so the perl API needs to be tolerant of the same.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Message::XML-Dumper-removed">MQSeries::Message::XML-Dumper removed</h2>

<p>As this module did not compile, it probably wasn&#39;t used by anyone.</p>

<h2 id="Bug-in-Extended-PCF-Command-InquireAuthority-fixed">Bug in Extended PCF Command &quot;InquireAuthority&quot; fixed</h2>

<p>The keyword in the hash tables used to map strings to PCF macros had a bug. Principal was mispelled, causing any query of permissions that involved principals to fail.</p>

<p>This was guaranteed to impact only MSDW....</p>

<h2 id="Minor-bug-in-handling-of-CompCode-Reason-values-from-MQSC-Commands">Minor bug in handling of CompCode/Reason values from MQSC Commands</h2>

<p>These are really hex values, and we were pretending that they were decimal. This generates warning when the values are used for numerical comparisons.</p>

<p>The CompCode and Reason values are now &quot;eval&quot;ed as hex, and thus converted to decimal values.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-ReasonText-documented">MQSeries::Command-&gt;ReasonText documented</h2>

<p>This method returns either the MQReasonToText value for the commandd reason code, or the ReasonText returned by MQSC. It wasn&#39;t documented. It is now.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-CreateObject-takes-Force-argument">MQSeries::Command-&gt;CreateObject takes Force argument</h2>

<p>You can&#39;t pass Force as an object attribute, since it is supported by ChangeFoo but not by CreateFoo commands, in general. The specification of Force is not an argument to CreateObject itself, and should not be passed as a key in the Attrs hash.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.12">Changes for 1.12</h1>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-Responses">MQSeries::Command-&gt;Responses</h2>

<p>The &quot;Response&quot; method of the MQSeries::Command class conflicts with the MQSeries::Command::Response class, and this causes headaches in some code. The method has been renamed to &quot;Responses&quot;.</p>

<p>Now, this is obviously a non-backwards compatible change, however, that method is very, very rarely used, and this will probably affect no existing code. But, you&#39;ve been warned.</p>

<h2 id="Support-for-control-of-implicitly-commited-transactions">Support for control of implicitly commited transactions</h2>

<p>WARNING: This is a very subtle, but very significant change to the API. Anyone using transactions should read and understand the implications for their application.</p>

<p>Normally, when there are pending tranactions due to uncommited MQPUT() and/or MQGET() calls, they will be implicitly backed out if the application crashes. This is a good thing. If the application chooses to cleanly exit, and calls MQDISC() without first calling MQCMIT(), then the transactions will be implicitly commited. This is a good thing, when you do it intentionally.</p>

<p>In the MQSeries::QueueManager object destructor, the code does an MQDISC() automatically in order to attempt to be a good citizen and cleanly disconnect from queue manager automatically. However, if an application has pending tranactions, and it traps a non-MQSeries related error and dies, object destruction still occurs, and this means that the pending transactions will be automatically commited, often to the surprise of the application developer.</p>

<p>This release offers the developer control of this behavior, via the new AutoCommit argument to the MQSeries::QueueManager constructor. If AutoCommit is disabled, then the object destructor will call MQBACK() before it calls MQDISC(), if there are pending transactions (the rest of the code conspires to keep track of this state information for you automatically, of course).</p>

<p>ANOTHER WARNING: The default behavior is not being changed in 1.12. AutoCommit will be 1 by default, and transactions will be automatically commited, in order to be backwards compatible with the current behavior. In 1.13, we will change this, since we feel very strongly that the intuitive behavior should be the default. If the application does not explicitly commit transactions, then they will be backed out when we destroy the MQSeries::QueueManager objects.</p>

<p>This means that applications will <b>NOT</b> be required to explicitly call MQBACK() (well, the -&gt;Backout() method, that is) in all of their error handling. This is especially important if you call some other API which itself raises fatal exceptions, since you won&#39;t be required to trap them and take special action. As of 1.13, we will Do The Right Thing.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::QueueManager-Connect-timeout-logic">MQSeries::QueueManager-&gt;Connect() timeout logic</h2>

<p>Attempts to connect to unhealthy queue managers can often hang indefinetely, and there is no way for applications to interrupt the connection, or trap the error. You simply hang until the queue manager (or the wedged component) is killed.</p>

<p>The new MQSeries::QueueManager support a ConnectTimeout attributes which puts a time limit on the MQCONN() call.</p>

<h2 id="OS-390-Support">OS/390 Support</h2>

<p>The modules now compile and install on OS/390. See the README file for version details.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Config::Authority">MQSeries::Config::Authority</h2>

<p>A new class under MQSeries::Config, which can be used to parse and query authority files under Unix. The &#39;saveauth&#39; program in the &#39;examples&#39; directory shows how this can be used to save all object authorities in a file of &#39;setmqaut&#39; commands.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-CreateObject-fix:-Change-not-Create">MQSeries::Command-&gt;CreateObject fix: Change, not Create</h2>

<p>Actually, this fixes a pretty serious bug. CreateObject, which is a wonderfully powerful command, was also rather dangerous, because the author (er, uh, that would be me -- wpm) got a bit pazy, and just used the PCF Create commands, with the Replace option. That works fine if you are always specifying all or most of the attributes you care about. If, however, you provide a subset of the attributes you care about, the others will get wiped out, since you are giving a sparse set of attributes to, say, CreateQueue.</p>

<p>The code will now DTRT and use the Change commands if the object already exists, and Create if it doesn&#39;t. This is far safer, and makes the code very robust.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-CreateObject-fix:-Comparing-lists">MQSeries::Command-&gt;CreateObject fix: Comparing lists</h2>

<p>If one of the attributes passed in is a single element ARRAY reference, it would not compare correctly with a real object attribute of only one element, since the inquiry API will not return it as an ARRAY reference unless there are two or more entries. A single element ARRAY ref will be flattened to a scalar to make this comparison correct.</p>

<h2 id="Limit-the-max-of-open-files-for-MQSeries::FDC::Tail">Limit the max # of open files for MQSeries::FDC::Tail</h2>

<p>Some vendors impose a limit of 255 stdio files that can be open at the same time (though the number of open file descriptors can be quite a bit higher). For an queue manager running really poorly, the number of FDC files being written may be higher than that, causing perl to die with a &quot;too many open files&quot; error. The MQSeries::FDC::Tail class will now close and re-open files in such circumstances (using a least-recently-used approach).</p>

<h2 id="Support-for-symbolic-Wait-and-Expiry-values">Support for symbolic Wait and Expiry values</h2>

<p>The &#39;Wait&#39; and &#39;Expiry&#39; parameters for MQSeries::Command, MQSeries::Queue and MQSeries::PubSub::Command are specified in units of 1/1000 and 1/10 of a second, making it easy to get the magnitude wrong. These parameters can now also be specified as symbolic values, e.g. &#39;45s&#39; for 45 seconds and &#39;2m&#39; for 2 minutes.</p>

<p>NOTE: These symbolic values work at the API top-level, but not when you manually create a MsgDesc hash. Low-level values must be specified in numeric form.</p>

<h2 id="Use-of-GetConvert-error-checked-properly">Use of GetConvert() error checked properly</h2>

<p>See the 1.11 changes notes about PutConvert, roughly a page or so below this. It was an oversight not to make the analagous changes for GetConvert as well as PutConvert.</p>

<h2 id="GetConvertReason-and-PutConvertReason-methods-added">GetConvertReason() and PutConvertReason() methods added</h2>

<p>It is now possible to determine if the failure of a Put(), Put1() or Get() method calls was a result of a failed PutConvert() or GetConvert() method, which is called internally by each of the first 3 methods.</p>

<p>This is important when you want to know if the error was a result of an improperly formatted message body, or an MQSeries problem.</p>

<p>While some noise gets generated via carp, there was until now no way to determine this programmatically.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command:-Support-for-ordered-attributes">MQSeries::Command: Support for ordered attributes</h2>

<p>The DeleteQueue command has an undocumented dependency on the order of its optional attributes. We enhanced the configuration of the PCF attributes such that we can now specify the order for these parameters. Without this change, commands that specified the Purge option worked half the time, since it was just lucky if perl pulled the hash entries out in the right order.</p>

<p>Now, we force the parameters to be converted into PCF code in the correct order. Currently, this only applies to the Optional parameters for DeleteQueue, but if we run into any further undocumented order dependencies, we can accomodate them easily.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.11">Changes for 1.11</h1>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Config::-classes">MQSeries::Config::* classes</h2>

<p>Two new classes under MQSeries::Config, specifically Machine and QMgr, allow read access to the parsed /var/mqm/mqs.ini and /var/mqm/qmgrs/*/qm.ini files.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::ErrorLog::-classes">MQSeries::ErrorLog::* classes</h2>

<p>Three new classes under MQSeries::ErrorLog, specifically Tail, Parser, and Entry, allow parsing and monitoring of errorlog files (/var/mqm/errors/AMQERR0x.LOG, /var/mqm/qmgrs/*/errors/AMQERR0x.LOG).</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::FDC::-classes">MQSeries::FDC::* classes</h2>

<p>Three new classes under MQSeries::FDC, specifically Tail, Parser, and Entry, allow parsing and monitoring of FDC files (/var/mqm/errors/*.FDC).</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Message::DeadLetter-object">MQSeries::Message::DeadLetter object</h2>

<p>A new subclass of MQSeries::Message, which implements parsing of the MQDLH, has been added to the distribution. This makes it trivial to write dead letter queue handler applications in perl.</p>

<h2 id="Use-of-PutConvert-error-checked-properly">Use of PutConvert() error checked properly</h2>

<p>We only error check the return value of the PutConvert() method is one was actually called. This makes it possible to put empty messages (where all of the information you care about is in the header, for example).</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-CreateObject-method-handles-lists-correctly">MQSeries::Command-&gt;CreateObject method handles lists correctly</h2>

<p>This method tries very hard not to alter objects whose attributes are already correctly set, but the previous version couldn&#39;t handle comparing attributes whose values were lists. For example, if you give more than one exit to the MsgExit parameter of a channel, then the PCF query will return a list of values, and this is represented as an ARRAY reference.</p>

<p>The new version will correctly compare the array elements, and thus correctly determine whether or not the attributes with multiple values are in fact correct. And yes, order is of course important.</p>

<h2 id="All-GetConvert-methods-save-raw-Buffer">All GetConvert() methods save raw Buffer</h2>

<p>In all of the following modules, the GetConvert() method will save the raw buffer, which in gives the developer access to the raw, unconverted data, via the MQSeries::Message-&gt;Buffer() method.</p>

<pre><code>  MQSeries::Message::Storable
  MQSeries::Message::XML-Dumper
  MQSeries::Message::RulesFormat
  MQSeries::Message::DeadLetter (new in 1.11 -- see above)
  MQSeries::Message::PCF

  MQSeries::Command::Response
  MQSeries::PubSub::AdminMessage</code></pre>

<p>A similar change was made to MQSeries::Message::Event, in the 1.09 release, but this has not been done for all of the supported modules in the distribution, for consistency (and, because the author happened to need this for MQSeries::Message::Storable).</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::PubSub::-ModelQName-DynamicQName-configurable">MQSeries::PubSub::*, ModelQName DynamicQName configurable</h2>

<p>Previously, the name of the permanent dynamic model queue, and dynamic queue name to be created, were simply hardcoded in the object constructor for both of</p>

<pre><code>  MQSeries::PubSub::Broker
  MQSeries::PubSub::Stream</code></pre>

<p>Both are now configurable via arguments to the constructor.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::PubSub::AdminMessage-_TranslatePCF">MQSeries::PubSub::AdminMessage-&gt;_TranslatePCF</h2>

<p>This one is hard to explain. The code to parse the PCF admin messages for PubSub wasn&#39;t handling multiple subscriber identities correctly. It does now.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Queue-Open-was-silent-on-non-retried-errors">MQSeries::Queue-&gt;Open() was silent on non-retried errors</h2>

<p>There was a missing else condition to carp about an MQOPEN failure, if the ReasonCode was <b>not</b> in the list of values to be retried. This causes significant confusion, since the failure is silent.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.10">Changes for 1.10</h1>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-MQSC-bugs">MQSeries::Command MQSC bugs</h2>

<p>Thanks to yet another data length limitation, the string &quot;INITIALIZING&quot; is too long for OS/390 to display, so this gets truncated to &quot;INITIALIZI&quot;, for output of the InquireChannelStatus() command, only on that platform. The API can parse this correctly now.</p>

<p>The IndexType values weren&#39;t properly mapped on either requests or responses. Now they are.</p>

<p>The HardenGetBackout paremeter was incorrectly encoded in MQSC. It is now.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Message-allows-BufferLength-of-0">MQSeries::Message allows BufferLength of 0</h2>

<p>This is one that came back to haunt me, as I thought I had fixed this way back in 1.04. If you attempt to create an MQSeries::Message with a BufferLength of zero, you actually get one with the default value of 32K. This is bad, if you are writing some code to say, browse a queue and just get all of the headers, as you end up getting some of the data, too. The code does the right thing now, and properly accepts a BufferLength of 0.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-CreateObject-enhancements-and-documentation">MQSeries::Command-&gt;CreateObject enhancements and documentation</h2>

<p>I added a new key (Clear) to indicate that when replacing a Local queue with another QType, the Local queue should be cleared before being deleted.</p>

<p>There are also a couple of examples in the SYNOPSIS section, and documentation for the new method call. This can now be considered production, and is no longer experimental. The author uses this call almost exclusively, in new development, for creating objects.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.09">Changes for 1.09</h1>

<h2 id="Support-for-Win32">Support for Win32</h2>

<p>This release compiles on Windows NT 4.0, and has thus far been tested with ActiveState 5.00503, build 521, with Visual C++ 6.0. Other perl/compiler combinations will probably follow, but the initial support is all the author has to test. I&#39;ve tested it with 5.0 as a client, and 5.1 as both client and server.</p>

<p>NOTE: (and a WARNING, too). This code determines where your MQSeries installation is by querying the Windows Registry, using Win32::TieRegistry. This is done not only at compile time (to find the includes files and shared libs), but also at run time to determine whether or not to use the client or server API, automatically.</p>

<h2 id="Retry-logic-in-MQSeries::QueueManager-Connect-and-MQSeries::Queue-Open">Retry logic in MQSeries::QueueManager-&gt;Connect() and MQSeries::Queue-&gt;Open()</h2>

<p>The retry logic was always there in MQSeries::QueueManager-&gt;Connect(), but now it is much more configurable. You can specify which reasons codes are worth retrying, rather than depend on a hardcoded (and possibly wrong or incorrect) list.</p>

<p>MQSeries::Queue-&gt;Open() also support retry logic, and the author finds this very useful for daemons recovering from a previous crash, attempting to open a queue for exclusive input, and waiting for the previously invoked agent process to free up the input handle.</p>

<p>The documentation for both modules has a RETRY LOGIC section. See that for more information, as well as the documentation for the constructors, and each of the specific methods.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-new-takes-additional-arguments">MQSeries::Command-&gt;new takes additional arguments.</h2>

<p>The MQSeries::Command constructor takes additional arguments allowing you to specify the Model Queue, and DynamicQName used to open the dynamic reply queue for command messages.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-CreateObject-method-added">MQSeries::Command-&gt;CreateObject() method added</h2>

<p>WARNING: This new method, while being Very Cool, is EXPERIMENTAL, and intentionally not documented, as the API will likely change. It will probably stabilize in 1.10.</p>

<p>CreateObject is a higher level wrapper function that will only create the specified object if it doesn&#39;t exist, or the specified attributes don&#39;t match. This is a conditional object creation, that will be a noop if the object is already correctly configured.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::QueueManager-Hconn-reference-counting">MQSeries::QueueManager Hconn reference counting</h2>

<p>A global hash, keyed on the process ID, and the Hconn value, will keep track of how many MQSeries::QueueManager objects have been instantiated for a given queue manager connections (since the Hconn values get reused). The object destructor will now decrement these values, and only the last object will actually disconnect from the queue manager.</p>

<p>This is actually a significant enhancement, as it was possible to pre-maturely disconnect from the queue manager when instantiating lots of objects, all of them specifying the queue manager by name, and thus internally recreating lots of MQSeries::QueueManager objects. The first one to get destroyed would wipe out the connection, causing problems for the others.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::QueueManager-constructor-arguments">MQSeries::QueueManager constructor arguments</h2>

<p>The constructor argument QueueManager can now be another MQSeries::QueueManager argument, and the QueueManager name will be stolne from that object, and a new one instantiated. This really just allows an MQSeries::QueueManager object to be passed to the MQSeries::PubSub::Broker constructor, actually.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Queue-Open-ignores-the-Hobj-on-errors">MQSeries::Queue-&gt;Open() ignores the Hobj on errors</h2>

<p>The Hobj value returned by MQOPEN() is only saved in the object hash when the CompCode is either MQCC_OK or MQCC_WARNING. The value when there is a failure can be a large, useless negative number, but then this looks like a true value in perl.</p>

<p>This confuses the subsequent attempts to call -&gt;Open(), which are supposed to return true if the object is already opened. This was done via:</p>

<pre><code>        return 1 is $self-&gt;{Hobj};</code></pre>

<p>which will be wrong. This is primarily relevant is you implement any form of retry logic for failed queue opens.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Message-Buffer-method-added">MQSeries::Message-&gt;Buffer() method added</h2>

<p>A new method to return the raw buffer from an MQGET() call. This is relevant for classes which use GetConvert() methods to translate the raw data into a customized form. If they save the raw buffer into $self-&gt;{Buffer}, then it will be available.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Message::Event-GetConvert-saves-raw-Buffer">MQSeries::Message::Event-&gt;GetConvert() saves raw Buffer</h2>

<p>This GetConvert() method will save the raw buffer, which in this case gives the developer access to the raw PCF data. The author uses this to echo the original event, in its unaltered format, to other systems management packages, afte rhe gets to it first.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.08">Changes for 1.08</h1>

<p>This is another relatively minor bug fix release, but since I&#39;m releasing it internally at MSDW, I&#39;m also releasing it to CPAN as well.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Message::Event-was-broken">MQSeries::Message::Event was broken</h2>

<p>I made a global variable lexically scoped to its file with an erroneous &quot;my&quot; keyword. Don&#39;t do that. The Event parsing class was totally broken as a result.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command-error-checking-enhancement">MQSeries::Command error checking enhancement</h2>

<p>When a command fails, the Reason() was being set to the last reason code found in the returned messages, which is always 3008 (command failed). Now the code will catch the first non-zero return code, and default to that, and this reason code is usually the one you want.</p>

<p>For example, InquireQueue for a non-existent queue name will now return 2085 (object not found), instead of the generic and uninteresting 3008.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::QueueManager-and-MQSeries::Queue-constructor-bug">MQSeries::QueueManager and MQSeries::Queue constructor bug</h2>

<p>Although I don&#39;t recommend using this particular interface, the constructors for both of these classes allow you to pass scalar references for the Reason and CompCode, so that the MQCONN() or MQOPEN() errors, if any, can be obtained.</p>

<p>These were only being set if there was an error, and now they are set regardless. Thus, if you initialize the values to, say MQRC_UNEXPECTED_ERROR and MQCC_FAILED, they will be left that way.</p>

<p>Note that I highly recommend using the NoAutoConnect and NoAutoOpen arguments, and then error checking the -&gt;Connect() and -&gt;Open() methods explicitly. The resulting code is much cleaner, IM!HO.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Queue-Put-method-wasnt-setting-MQPMO_FAIL_IF_QUIESCING">MQSeries::Queue-&gt;Put() method wasn&#39;t setting MQPMO_FAIL_IF_QUIESCING</h2>

<p>The various *_FAIL_IF_QUIESCING options are set everywhere by default (as the author happens to beleive they should be), except here. This is fixed.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::PubSub::Broker-Stream-API-enhanced-to-support-alternate-users">MQSeries::PubSub::Broker/Stream API enhanced to support alternate users</h2>

<p>In order to enable the development of adminstrative tools for Publish/Subscribe which allow me to age bogus subscriptions (i.e. subscriptions that point to non-existent queues), I needed to be able to DeregisterSubscriber as an alternate user ID.</p>

<p>The API was enhanced to expose a bit more of the underlying method calls in order to make this possible.</p>

<p>In addition, several minor bugs in the Administrative PubSub API were fixed, making it possible to get at almost all of the metatopic information easily.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.07">Changes for 1.07</h1>

<p>This release is a minor bug fix release, but one of them is significant enough to justify a public release.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Message::PCF-memory-leak">MQSeries::Message::PCF memory leak</h2>

<p>The MQDecodePCF routine didn&#39;t properly mortalize the references it returns. I hate it when that happens. The result was that long-running applications that used the Command API (or any of the PCF-based formats) heavily (guess what the author was developing when he discovered this? ;-) will leak memory heavily. This is fixed.</p>

<p>In addition, the same error was made in the MQSeries::Message::RulesFormat XS code as well, and that was also fixed.</p>

<p>Note that none of the basic MQI interfaces had any problems at all. There are now no known memory leaks anywhere in the XS code. We&#39;ve had long running perl daemons up for weeks using the basic MQSeries interface, with no reported issues.</p>

<h2 id="Change-to-simplify-static-compiles">Change to simplify static compiles</h2>

<p>The obnoxious, er, I mean, very important and absolutely essential legal question about the LICENSE file will be asked only once. When compiling statically, the Makefile.PL gets run again, and if it blocks on input this is not only annoying, but it breaks the static compile.</p>

<h2 id="Default-Expiry-values-were-wrong">Default Expiry values were wrong</h2>

<p>The default Expiry values used in the MQSeries::Command API were incorrect, having the same value as the WaitInterval. As you probably know, Expiry is tenths of a second, and Wait is milliseconds. Oops.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.06">Changes for 1.06</h1>

<p>This release is the first to make it to CPAN (the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network), as the primary distribution mechanism, rather than IBM&#39;s proprietary Support Pac web site. In addition, this code is now copyrighted by MSDW (the author&#39;s employer) but released under a license which is based on the Perl Artistic License.</p>

<p>It is now truly Open Source. Viva the Revolution, baby...</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::PubSub">MQSeries::PubSub::*</h2>

<p>The entire Publish/Subscribe API is new with this release. This includes the following modules:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="MQSeries::PubSub::Command">MQSeries::PubSub::Command</dt>
<dd>

<p>A base class for all of the Publish/Subscribe commands, this module is not used directly, but rather one of its two subclasses is.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="MQSeries::PubSub::Broker">MQSeries::PubSub::Broker</dt>
<dd>

<p>This subclass of MQSeries::PubSub::Command, and MQSeries::QueueManager, implements an interface to the Broker-specific Publish/Subscribe commands.</p>

<p>This module also supports an set of &quot;Extended Commands&quot;, which are higher level interfaces to the contents of the administrative inforamtion in the metatopics.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="MQSeries::PubSub::Stream">MQSeries::PubSub::Stream</dt>
<dd>

<p>This subclass of MQSeries::PubSub::Command, and MQSeries::Queue, implements an interface to the Stream-specific Publish/Subscribe commands.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="MQSeries::PubSub::Message">MQSeries::PubSub::Message</dt>
<dd>

<p>This subclass of MQSeries::Message::RulesFormat provides an interface for creating and parsing MQRFH-formated Publish/Subscribe messages.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="MQSeries::PubSub::AdminMessage">MQSeries::PubSub::AdminMessage</dt>
<dd>

<p>This quasi-subclass (not a *true* OO subclass, but who&#39;s looking) of MQSeries::Message::PCF provides an interface to the Publish/Subscribe administrative messages published in PCF format.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Message::PCF">MQSeries::Message::PCF</h2>

<p>This is a new class which provides a much more generic interface to PCF messages. Prior to this release, there were several routines which parsed implementation-specific formats, with a lot of duplicated code.</p>

<p>This class can be used directly, but it was primary designed so that its two core functions (MQEncodePCF and MQDecodePCF) would be used as building blocks for the implementation-specific formats, such as Performance Events (MQSeries::Message::Event), Command server requests and responses (MQSeries::Command::*), and the Publish/Subscribe administrative messages (MQSeries::PubSub::AdminMessage).</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Message::RulesFormat">MQSeries::Message::RulesFormat</h2>

<p>This is a new class which provides an interface to the MQRFH Rules and Format messages used by the Publish/Subscribe system. This can also be used to create messages for working with the NEON MQIntegrator 1.X product suites, since the format is the same, although the author hasn&#39;t actually tried this yet.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Message::XML-Dumper">MQSeries::Message::XML-Dumper</h2>

<p>This is a new subclass of MQSeries::Message which encodes/decodes complex perl data structures using the XML-Dumper module. This was mostly done as a proof of principle, and to please some XML zealots.</p>

<p>Note that the parsing of XML is much more expensive than the Storable approach, and if you have a perl process on the sending and receiving end of a message flow, the author still recommends using Storable.</p>

<p>This requires the CPAN XML::Dumper and XML::Parser modules.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command">MQSeries::Command</h2>

<dl>

<dt id="More-complete-documentation">More complete documentation</dt>
<dd>

<p>The various strings used to represent the PCF parameters and values have finally been documented, so someone other than the author may actually be able to use this code.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Extended-to-V5.1-PCF-Commands">Extended to V5.1 PCF Commands</dt>
<dd>

<p>All of the new Commands for V5.1 are supported, and in fact, even if you compile the MQSeries API with 5.0, you can still use the new commands, and parse the resulting PCF parameters. The code which maps numeric parameters to key strings has been &quot;flattened&quot; such that it doesn&#39;t use the actual C macros.</p>

<p>These files (MQSeries/Command/PCF/*.pl) were auto-generated on an MQSeries 5.1 host, so the macro-to-number mapping has already been done, and it is not necessary for the C macro to have been compiled into constants.c.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Extended-to-V2.1-MQSC-Commands">Extended to V2.1 MQSC Commands</dt>
<dd>

<p>Most, but not all, of the MQSC commands (i.e. commands sent to an MQSC-only command server, for example an MVS queue manager) have been supported, and the API can parse all of new V2.1 object attributes (like &quot;ALTDATE&quot; and &quot;ALTTIME&quot;).</p>

<p>WARNING: The MQSC code has not been extensively tested, so use it with caution.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="MQSeries::QueueManager">MQSeries::QueueManager</h2>

<dl>

<dt id="NoAutoConnect-option">NoAutoConnect option</dt>
<dd>

<p>The call to MQCONN is normally done in the constructor, but if it fails, the error checking semantics are ugly. A new option (NoAutoConnect) disables the implicit call to -&gt;Connect(), and allows the developer to make this call, and error check it explicitly.</p>

<p>The Connect() method is also new.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Inquire-MQINQ-Support">Inquire/MQINQ Support</dt>
<dd>

<p>Method calls have added to support the MQINQ() call against the queue manager itself. This includes both Open() and Close() methods, which were not previously available.</p>

<p>The Open() method is also new, although it is just a rename of the older semi-private _mqopen() method call.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Queue">MQSeries::Queue</h2>

<dl>

<dt id="NoAutoOpen-option">NoAutoOpen option</dt>
<dd>

<p>The call to MQOPEN is normally done in the constructor, but if it fails, the error checking semantics are ugly. A new option (NoAutoOpen) disables the implicit call to -&gt;Open(), and allows the developer to make this call, and error check it explicitly.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Inquire-Set-MQINQ-MQSET-Support">Inquire/Set MQINQ/MQSET Support</dt>
<dd>

<p>Method calls have added to support the MQINQ() and MQSET() calls against queues.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Close-method-call">Close method call</dt>
<dd>

<p>Objects can now be explicitly closed. In previous releases this was done via the object destructor, and thus couldn&#39;t be error checked. Implicit closing is still preferred, but CloseOptions can be given to the constructor to control how the object is closed.</p>

<p>This is particularly useful for creating permanent dynamic queues (which can accept persistent messages) which are purged and deleted upon close.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="MQSeries-core-module">MQSeries core module</h2>

<dl>

<dt id="Null-valued-macros-properly-supported">Null-valued macros properly supported</dt>
<dd>

<p>There are several macros, such as MQCI_NONE, which are a fixed length string of null characters. These were not properly defined in the constants.c file, and thus couldn&#39;t be used as expected.</p>

<p>Now, these macros all evaluate to a string of nulls of the correct length, this you can use them precisely as documented in the MQI docs.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="MQParseEvent-MQCommandRequestPCF-MQCommandResponsePCF-and-MQParseDeadLetter">MQParseEvent, MQCommandRequestPCF, MQCommandResponsePCF and MQParseDeadLetter</dt>
<dd>

<p>These core module subroutines were removed.</p>

<p>MQParseDeadLetter never worked, and it will be implemented (eventually) in the same way that MQSeries::Message::RulesFormat was done, with its own XS source file.</p>

<p>The other 3 all dealt with very specific implementations of the PCF format, and these were replaced by the MQSeries::Message::PCF class, which provides very generic PCF parsing and encoding routines (MQEncodePCF and MQDecodePCF).</p>

<p>Mapping the generic PCF into message format specific data is done by &quot;private&quot; class methods _TranslatePCF in each of the relevant OO modules.</p>

<p>This was a key prerequisite for developing MQSeries::PubSub::AdminMessage, which is also based on a PCF message format. Future implementations of special formats based on PCF should be easy. Of course, now IBM wants to move to XML for everything, so...</p>

</dd>
<dt id="MQReasonToStrings">MQReasonToStrings</dt>
<dd>

<p>This subroutine&#39;s implementation was dramatically reworked.</p>

<p>This used to be implemented in C, inside the XS routine, but now the hash of key/value pairs mapping a numeric ReasonCode to a readable test string is done via a pair of automatically compiled files (MQSeries/Constants/Reason*.pl)</p>

<p>In fact, all of the files in MQSeries/Constants are auto-generated from templates in src/pre.in, by the tool src/util/flatten_macros. This is a huge win, as it basically does the macro-to-value mapping such that the perl API is dealing with raw numbers.</p>

<p>There is a non-trivial startup cost otherwise, as each and every macro has to be looked up in the symbol table, the AUTOLOAD function called, a C subroutine called, etc. This saves a few seconds of startup time.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="XS-code-streamlined">XS code streamlined</dt>
<dd>

<p>Most of the non-MQI subroutines were removed entirely, or moved elsewhere. The MQSeries.xs.in directory is much more lean.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="XS-code-no-longer-leaks-memory">XS code no longer leaks memory</dt>
<dd>

<p>The author now fully understands the XS concepts of mortality and reference counts, and the code returns correctly mortalized, and properly reference counted values.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Support-for-default-queue-manager">Support for &quot;default&quot; queue manager</dt>
<dd>

<p>The QueueManager key is no longer required by most of the OO API constructors. If you have configured a default queue manager for your environment, then you can use it with the OO API as of this release. Before, the QueueManager key was required to have a true value, and since the default queue manager is &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot; is false...</p>

<dt id="required-not-5.005">5.004 required, not 5.005</dt>
<dd>

<p>The 5.005 prerequisite was relaxed to 5.004, and the requirement that the perl interpreter itself be linked directly with -lthread (or -lpthread, or whatever) was removed. The MQSeries.so libraries are themselves compiled with the appropriate dependencies on libthread, and this code now works fine with a standard, out-of-the-tarball compile of perl5.004 or later.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="New-CONFIG-parameters">New CONFIG parameters</dt>
<dd>

<p>It is now possible to explicitly disable either the server or client API compile. The Makefile.PL now does a more generic job of determining whether or not you appear to have support for the server API, which is the more common case (eg. Linux, SunOS and IRIX only have client implementations available).</p>

<p>At least one site didn&#39;t support clients at all, and they didn&#39;t want to build in the support, so they can now turn it off via CONFIG.</p>

<p>Compilation of the MQServer::MQSeries API is automatically disabled on SunOS 4.1.3 and IRIX hosts, for which we do not have a server API.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="constants.c.PL-added">constants.c.PL added</dt>
<dd>

<p>The huge, growing list of MQSeries C macros are now extracted from the MQSeries C include files automatically, and the @EXPORT list is built dynamically. The code for constants.c is also auto-generated, and the code handles several different types of constant (hex, string, character, etc).</p>

<p>The code also parses all of the available C header files, and makes all possible macros available. This makes maintenance of the macro list easy, but it does result in significant bloat of the namespace exported by MQSeries. So be it.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Test-suite">Test suite</dt>
<dd>

<p>The test suite was reorganized to a SysV-style rc.d directory syntax, with files named 10foo.t, 20bar.t, etc.</p>

</dd>

<h2 id="MQSeries">MQSeries</h2>

<dl>

<dt id="Distribution-List-Support">Distribution List Support</dt>
<dd>

<p>Support for Distribution lists was added to the core MQI functions, such as MQOPEN, MQPUT and MQPUT1. This required a significant re-architecture of these functions. The OO API classes were also extended to support dist lists as well.</p>

<p>This functionality is all enabled only if one compiles with V5, of course.</p>

<dt id="MQCONN-retry-logic">MQCONN retry logic</dt>

<p>The MQCONN retry logic is disabled by default.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Queue1">MQSeries::Queue</h2>

<dl>

<dt id="MQOPEN-retry-logic">MQOPEN retry logic</dt>
<dd>

<p>This was stripped out of the code entirely, since it never really worked, and I doubt it ever would have. Bad idea.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="AutoResize-logic">AutoResize logic</dt>
<dd>

<p>Logic was added to adjust the buffer size automatically, and retry an MQGET() call, when a truncated message is received, and truncated messages are not accepted. This functionality is available in the C++ API, the source of inspiration for the idea.</p>

</dd>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command1">MQSeries::Command</h2>

<dl>

<dt id="Documentation">Documentation</dt>
<dd>

<p>This module was finally documented, but only the object constructor and basic methods were documented. Complete documentation of the command syntax was not added until 1.06.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.04">Changes for 1.04</h1>

<h2 id="MQSeries1">MQSeries</h2>

<p>Supports explicit loading of MQClient::MQSeries or MQServer::MQSeries, rather than implicit only.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Command2">MQSeries::Command</h2>

<p>Introduce the Command Server API, for both PCF and MQSC command messages.</p>

<h2 id="MQSeries::Message::Storable">MQSeries::Message::Storable</h2>

<p>Uses nfreeze, which is supposed to use network byte order, rather than freeze.</p>

<h1 id="Changes-for-1.03">Changes for 1.03</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="OO-API">OO API</dt>
<dd>

<p>First implementation of the OO portion of the API</p>

</dd>
<dt id="XS-source">XS source</dt>
<dd>

<p>Eliminated the dual XS file templates, using one source for both V2 and V5</p>

</dd>
<dt id="MQSeries-core">MQSeries core</dt>
<dd>

<p>Added two new utility functions to the core API:</p>

<pre><code>    MQParseEvent
    MQReasonToText</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="Locale-hacks">Locale hacks</dt>
<dd>

<p>MQSeries.pm will automagically set reasonable values for the LANG and NLSPATH environment variables, if not set.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Documentation1">Documentation</dt>
<dd>

<p>Significantly expanded documentation</p>

<dt id="Introduced-the-extended-test-suite">Introduced the extended test suite</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt id="Dual-client-server-support">Dual client/server support</dt>
<dd>

<p>Introduced the dual namespaces to make client vs. server usage transparent. That is, MQSeries.pm really pulls in MQServer/MQSeries.pm on a queue manager, and MQClient/MQSeries.pm otherwise.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="PLMQ---MQSeries">PLMQ -&gt; MQSeries</dt>
<dd>

<p>Change the module name from PLMQ to MQSeries, and changed the API calls from GET to MQGET, etc., making the function mapping one to one.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="typemap.PL">typemap.PL</dt>
<dd>

<p>Automated the typemap generation using a typemap.PL file</p>

</dd>
